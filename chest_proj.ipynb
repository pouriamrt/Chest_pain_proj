         "What's up? Can I leave this here? Yeah, sure. And Heather, I actually you've been having some discomfort in your chest. Yes, and a lot of abdominal discomfort as well. OK, Why don't you have a seat over here? So I thought it was just abdominally stuff and then I put up and then it sore in my back and around here that was made it hard to breathe. And then I thought, oh, this isn't fantastic way to start my game. Yeah, no kidding. So I wasn't too sure what was going on and I don't know if I was being overly. I don't think so. Nervous. Did you feel nauseous? Yes. Do you feel like you're did you did you vomit? No, no, no, I just felt really yucky and it's for a few days it's been cramped, a lot of cramping and then I just feel bloated and awful. And then today it added with the pain. I went OK. Have you had any fevers? I don't think so, but I felt weird yesterday. But I'm not sure. I didn't test it. Have you noticed that the pain changes or fluctuates with meals? Pain changes or fluctuates? Not really. Not really. So up until probably about a week ago, I probably had very, like IBS, like symptoms of when I would eat, cramp, Go. Yeah. And now it's cramp all the time. Yes. OK. Any blood in your stool? No, not that I've seen. And since this pain is developed, you're still going regularly? Yes, although it's been more difficult the last two days. And is that more difficult because you're in pain, so it's harder to go, or is it like your stools are hard? A bit of both. OK, So the back end's sore and then it's a bit harder to go than normal. Normally, you know, my IBS would kick in first thing in the morning and everything would and then I'd be right as rain by the afternoon. And now it's just sort of seems all loaded. And yeah. Are you getting any like, reflux like symptoms? Are you getting any burning in like the in your throat or like a bitter taste in your mouth? No. OK. No. Are you burping more than usual? No. Good. Do you feel out of breath? No. OK. I don't think so. And do you feel the pain is because you mentioned both like abdominal as well as some chest discomfort, But where you're gesturing is more sort of like upper abdomen to me. Yeah. So I think I don't know whether I've been straining and then I may have pulled the back muscle, which is what's making the pain go up and under here. Yes. And it's. And it's sort of under. Yeah. Under the bra and all on this side. OK. So that's why I thought, OK, that's new. Yeah. And not good. OK If you take a deep breath in, does it get worse? It's sore like like a popped out rib sore. Does it become more pronounced if you take a deep breath? Yes. OK Sharper. OK. Perfect. Yes, I know what you mean. If you lie on one side, is it worse? I haven't tried cause I've just been sitting all day. So I don't know. I don't know. It's sore. Sorry. I don't know. It's sore right in my back. So I don't. It's right in the middle of the back. Yeah, like sort of up or left like where it's area. It's going to lie this down. Good. I cannot lie down. Just going to pull this up, just going to push those spots because it's really crappy, like down, down lower. Yeah, yeah, I that's sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's sorry. I feel it. Pulling all the way. Pain over here. No pain over here? No, just a little bit, but not as bad as further down. Just a little little bit. No, it's a pain mostly in there, in there and then down here. Any burning when you go pee? No. Hey, sorry. No, it's OK. And do you know lots of women have fibroids on their ears? Do you have any ears? Do you know? I have no idea. I have an IUD. OK, But I don't know if I have anything else going on there. If I push here and let go, it feels better when you let go. OK. OK. And where I was pushing that, it seems like that's the thing that's making the pain worse. Is that correct? Yeah. Any burning when you go pee? No, no. Won't pee more than usual. Any changes in your usual vaginal discharge? No. OK. So I don't think that this discomfort that you're having in your chest relates to relates to your heart. OK, good. That's good. There's a few things that I'm. I'm kind of wondering about kind of there's like upper abdominal pain that's going into someone's back. I start wondering about this one of like a pancreas attack, especially this time of year. OK. The other thing is it's feeling like your sort of where your uterus and your bladder is feels a bit bulky to me. Now that could just be that you you're crampy and sore in that area. You have a fibroid. You probably you could have lived with it your entire life, but no one's been pushing the way I just was so no one's noticed it felt like this. So this is weird, but given that we've got that question plus the question, but your pancreas are going to get CAT scan, OK, It's going to give us quite a bit of information, OK? It's possible it's looking at like if everything sort of like higher looks good, CAT scans are like decent but not awesome for looking at like the uterus. But because it's going to give us more like a broader net, I think that's probably the best place for us to start. It's possible that they might say like, yeah, like maybe the uterus looks a bit weird, but we would need an ultrasound. If that happens, then we get the ultrasound. OK, OK. Just to just to open that up, just that that's a possibility. OK, OK. Yeah. So we're going to do all that, and I see that they've already taken some blood from you. Yes. I'm going to add the test that I want onto the blood that's already in the lab. OK. And we'll go from there and we'll get you some medication to make you feel more comfortable while you're waiting. OK. OK. Perfect. Stay here or go. I'll get you to grab your stuff and come with me. OK. Yeah, we'll and we'll, we'll make sure you're feeling less nauseous as well as more comfortable while you're waiting. Yeah. OK. All right."

         "Here and record everything and if you need, if you need that. Did you talk to him already? Yeah, I have took his history for this. It's fine. I'm Doctor Bainhart. Good. And how are you? Good. Mr. Hunter? Yeah. OK. So, umm, I was just reading your chart. Why don't you tell me in your own words what brings you in today? Uh, just yesterday morning and then this morning. And I had like, really a lot of tightness in my chest and then kind of felt like short of breath. Yesterday, I had, like, sweats as well. What time was that yesterday? Maybe like 8:00 AM and it's started at 8:00 AM with everything at once or did what? How did the like? Yeah, pretty much everything at once. Like, as soon as I got into bed, like, it kind of just felt that way. And then, you know, probably by like, like noon, like, things sort of improved. And then this morning, I kind of woke up again, same sort of deal, like tightness in my chest, short of breath, did enough sweats this morning, but then down like since being here, like things seem to have improved again. And where exactly do you feel the tightness? Kind of like right here? And it kind of just like spreads across both sides. Yeah. Does it wrap all the way around or? No, No. This morning I was having some upper back pain, though. OK, in relation, like it's spreading to the upper back, it was kind of just like both were happening at the same time, like. OK. And was the pain worse when you took a deep breath? Yeah, it almost felt like I couldn't take a deep breath like this, kind of like restricting things. So like if I tried to inhale deeply, it would be more. So would you describe the pain as like a sharp or burning or pressure or no more just like a dull aching, OK, like a warm feeling has me. And any do you notice any difference when exerting yourself, like if you were walking, going up stairs, anything like that? Not necessarily like maybe just the shortness of breath. Like I have noticed maybe like in the last six months, like when I'm at the gym and I'm doing cardio sometimes, like it's sometimes feel like I can't really catch my breath. OK. So shortness of breath, that's been kind of progressive. Yeah. But the pain wasn't necessarily worse. The tightness. Yeah. The tightness is kind of new, OK, Otherwise why was it positional at all? For example, like you said, you was like when you got out of bed, so being upright or laying down did anything. Yeah, I guess so like I, I kind of just woke up, got out of bed and then but I didn't like it seemed to matter what position I was in, I guess. OK. And did you take anything for the for the tightness like didn't So it just kind of resolved after about four hours. Yeah, without any change. That's right. Yeah. OK. And last night, after it got better, no shortness of breath at all. Yeah. No. Yeah, unfortunately. Any nausea, vomiting. Yesterday morning, I felt like a little. Any fevers? No cough, no congestion. Anyone in your household sick? No any like abdominal pain at all. No, not really. No changes in your bowel habits, no pain with urination, changes in urination, swelling in your legs at all. And any no radiology MRI responding for emerging care parts on line 1 neuro MRI. Sorry, it's one year listening to make sure it's not for me, but that's OK. So no pain, swelling in the legs at all? No. OK. And in terms of your medical history, yeah. What medical conditions? Nothing really. Like, I've been diagnosed with IBS and then most recently I just ticked up diabetes. OK. Do you take any medications? Have you ever had surgery before? Once Or like an Abscess? But where was that? I was like perianal Abscess. OK. And any allergies? No. Have you ever been a smoker? No. Any other substance use? Cannabis. No, just like alcohol. But how much alcohol? Maybe like a bottle of wine on the weekend, Like one or two drinks. OK, OK. And so any family history of heart disease? My grandfather had a lot of radiology. How probably around my SO Yeah, yeah. He had like 4 open heart surgeries. OK What about your, is that your paternal or maternal? Maternal and your father, he seems fine. Do you have any siblings with them either? OK, OK. And then just helpful to get an idea, especially with chest pain and like kind of that's relaxing and waning. How is like is there anything else going on in your life that's different than normal? Not different, no change in stress, change in kind of like work life, home life, anything else? No, it's pretty constant. Like I run my own business and then we have 4 kids at home. So like always pretty stressful, but OK, fair enough. So the good news is when we look at your preliminary stuff, so we looked at some blood work, we looked at ECG and we also did a chest X-ray. The blood work doesn't show any signs of you having a heart attack right now. So the way we look at that is an enzyme called troponin. Troponin is kind of secreted from the heart muscles when they're straining, when they're really not like happy. And yours was normal. So we would expect that if you were. If you're having a heart attack, it's elevated. So that's normal. That's good. We also look at an ECG, which is another measure to check if your heart is kind of doing anything abnormal. And yours was mostly normal. The rhythm was normal. There's no signs of a heart attack on it. You have a a slight bundle branch block, which is just a little conduction abnormality, but it's not a heart attack otherwise. Your chest X-ray also didn't show any pneumonia or anything else going on in the chest that would really explain this kind of presentation. The chest X-ray looked just normal, which is good. So where that kind of leaves us is that as of right now, the good news is the dangerous scary things have been ruled out. By that we mean kind of the heart attack, anything grossly wrong with the lungs, like if they're if you had to collapse lung or anything like that, that we would see that on an X-ray, which we don't see. And so it's good news, but it's also frustrating. So we don't have a good answer right now for what's causing this, OK? There are many things that can cause chest pain and shortness of breath. And especially when when you're having kind of recurring episodes, right. It might be reasonable for us to send you to see a cardiologist because it's not just a one off. Yeah, Yeah. But at this point, there's no like, kind of indication for you to have any surgery or anything like that because there's no signs of anything acute going on today. OK Would some sort of like blockage or something show up on these tests? Like like if you had a blockage in your arteries? Yeah. Yeah. So that's kind of like what I'm what I'm saying, heart attack. That's kind of what I'm referring to. OK. Yeah. So if you had a blockage in your arteries, that would cause the tissues to be not getting enough oxygen, right. And then we would start to see the troponin would go off. Oh, I see. OK. And then your ECG would change. OK. But we don't see that right now. OK, So what I'm going to do, because I'm a resident, is I'm going to talk with my boss and kind of go over your whole history and do your lab work and your ECG and your X-ray, and then we're going to come up with the final plan. But the good news is, as of right now, all the tests have been reassuring. Do you have a family doctor? I do, yeah. OK, because it might be. Anyway, I'm going to talk with them and see what they prefer, but that's good to know. Yeah. The only other weird thing that happened like two nights ago was like, I wear this often for sleeping and like my heart rate was like super elevated all night. Like how? Well, how high? Like I think it was a Max of like 95 per minute, like a low of 80. OK, yeah, I'm kind of odd, but I'm going to, I'm going to switch with you. And because we have this thing here, I'm going to get rid of this, but I'm going to do a full physical exam and then I'm going to review with my boss and then we'll talk about it more. That is high. But the range of normal for heart rates you is between like low 60s to 100. OK, Would be in the range of normal. It's a little. If it's higher than your normal, then you know, yeah, normally I'm like 5560 when I'm sleeping, right? So, yeah, so that's something to, to, to note. But that number, if you had told me it was 155, yeah, OK, that's different. That's, that tells me that your heart rate is like kind of the basically working out. Yeah. Like it's way too high. Yeah, yeah, that number is in the range of normal. It's maybe not your baseline, but it could be many things that could cause it to be sure in the range of normal just on the higher end. Yeah. OK, so here I'm going to give this back to the sure researcher and then, uh, I'm going to just do my exam and then we'll go from there, OK? Can I? You don't need this for the physical exam, right? Yeah."

         "Hi, my name is Taylor. I'm one of the student doctors that's working in an apartment today. I've been asked to come and see you and see what's going on. Can you tell me what brought you into hospital? Chest pain. Can you describe the chest pain that you're experiencing Sharp? OK. How long does the sharp pain usually last for? 10 minutes of constant sharp chest pain. OK, You said it radiates into your arm. Is it worse with movement? So it happens when you're on the stairs. Sometimes you're going to come to sleeping. OK, so it kind of comes randomly, lasts for 10 minutes. How often, how often do you get it? Like how often does it come? OK, How long in between? I think that's it. Hours, maybe like 3 hours. OK. You can't think of anything that makes it feel worse, OK, What makes it feel better? If I have a shift, I don't want that, OK. And so the pain just kind of goes away on its own. OK. And do you find that that helps? OK, OK Anything else that you find helpful? Like just anything that that helps with the pain? It goes and then it comes back. OK. So it goes away on its own. OK. On a scale of one to 10, what would you rate the pain when it comes to really sharp and it's painful, It can be 10. Does it hurt to take a deep breath? OK. Does it take a deep breath right now in between? Or is it, are you totally pain free in between the episodes? You're pain free. Yeah. OK. But when they're happening during that 10 minutes, it's hard to take a deep breath to swallow. It's hard. OK. Have you ever had trouble swallowing before? No. Any trouble eating, drooling, anything like that? Regurgitating up food? No. OK. Have you ever had a scope done just to look at your esophagus? Like you were put to sleep and had a scope inside? You probably know it would have been a whole day procedure. OK, the way I think about this, playing this time chemist like a museum, which is that's new for you. How long have you been experiencing this type of pain? For like years. OK, so it was something that you were struggling with last year and then it stopped for a while and now it's back. Sorry. OK Any history of heartburn? Yeah. Do you take anything for the heartburn? Yeah. I can't depreciate because I've been on heartburn. OK. Yeah. OK. So you said nausea? Any vomiting I did last week when I had a shot on Thursday? OK, so when did they? So they started on Thursday of last week again, started up again. OK, OK. When it comes after the fail, it remains weak for some time. OK. OK. All right. Any any recent fever? It's not like it's like I feel like my body is freezing for some minutes. Yeah. OK. During when it's happening. OK. All right. But no documented fever. You've been well otherwise, any infections? You've been well. OK. Any diarrhea, any belly pain, any shortness of breath? Is that when it's happening? Because you can't take a deep breath? More, OK. Like a puffer, OK. You find that help? OK, but when you say shortness of breath, does it feel like you can't get any air in or that you can't take a deep breath? OK, OK. When you do exert yourself, do you ever experience chest pain? Like if you're walking a long distance or climbing stairs, anything like that, do you find that you get chest pain from that? Only the stairs. OK, Have you found that you're more short of breath lately with exercise or with exertion? Has that changed at all? OK, any, any new headache? OK, so nothing new though. Any like loss of consciousness, feeling like you're going to pass out when you're climbing stairs. Can you describe that a bit more to me? I prefer I can I, I was feeling that, you know, you feel confused and you know, OK, so you felt like you were going to pass out, but only when you're climbing the stairs. No, I was not climbing. OK. I'm trying to differentiate between whether or not you're feeling like you're going to pass out when you're climbing the stairs. Feel chest pain when you're climbing the stairs. OK. But you don't feel like you're going to pass out or lose consciousness when you're climbing stairs. OK. OK. OK. All right. Do you have any medical conditions at all? No, don't take medications for anything. I don't know that name. OK. Any history of surgeries? I have one which was for necessary. OK, OK, OK, so let's just recap. So you've had these chest pains before you were investigated last year. They kind of went away until Thursday, this past Thursday, where you started to have them again, two to three episodes a day lasting 10 minutes each. During the 10 minutes, you have very sharp chest pain that radiates to your left arm, and then it seems to go away on its own. It's not necessarily worse with any movement or or any positioning, But you've noticed that you do get chest pain when you're climbing stairs, and you can feel like you're going to pass out when you're climbing stairs. Is that accurate? Yeah. But the 10 minutes is not that good because it's not. Sometimes it's not ten minutes long, but not more than that. OK. 10 to 30 minutes. OK, OK, Why don't we get you to set up? Take off your jacket, please. I have to listen to your heart. So that's why you're here. Hey, any swelling in your legs that you've noticed? So it's not consistent or. Would you see your legs look normal like right now? Like they're what you're used to seeing? I'm just going to listen to your back as well. Do you have any allergies at all? No. Can you go like this for me? Don't let me pull. Resist against me pulling. Same thing. Resist good. Don't let me push. Push against my hand. Shrug your shoulders up against my hands. Shrug. Like this? No. Like this. Yeah. And just kick against my hands. Here, push. Can you lift up against my hand? Good. OK. You've had no cough or anything? No. OK. When was the last time you that you had the chest pain? I came here 'cause I came in that OK? It was rated bad. When was the last time the timeline, timeline wise, Like how long did you, did you have the pain and immediately come to hospital? Yeah, 'cause that's what my physician said. But when I feel with this pain, I should come immediately. OK. Can you do, do you have a like the time is actually pretty important. Do you have the time specifically that you started experiencing the chest pain? I know that you came in at 4. OK. OK. And how long did it last that time? How long did the pain last? That was the first time that you've experienced nausea. Oh, no. You had it on Thursday. Yeah. OK, OK. I'm going to go chat with the doctor and we'll be back to come up with a plan, OK. Yeah, Actually, no, I'm going to get you to go into the hallway. Yeah. Room like the waiting area 20. Yeah. OK. Or Holly will show you where it is. OK."

And I don't know, I don't get Harper. Is it right in the middle? Right in the middle? So the way I described it is I had gallbladder a number of years ago. It's the same kind like or is it a bit lower? It's like, yeah, it's like right here, but it works its way up, right. So it's kind of like a new year and the shark like And so I thought it was Harper or something so that it just kind of impressively got worse. So when I was started out of 10, what was it do you think? It was probably like a three or four, like annoying grumbling. Yeah, but OK, I can handle it. And now and right now I actually feel probably the best to have since yesterday morning. We won't be jinxed. It wasn't when it was at its worst was this morning because I couldn't like, it was just soaking. Didn't throw up like 10 out of 10. Yeah. Yeah. Like I was like, OK, only if I drink some water and like, just because of the nausea, because of the does it hurt? Does it hurt as soon as I swallow it? Just. Oh, OK. Yeah, OK. Has anything like this happened before, and did anything make it worse other than the water? Yeah. So trying to eat or drink anything. Like I said, right now I'm laying down. OK, but laying down is worse. I tried. I don't know, maybe if it's heartburn or something. But that. Were you able to exercise? You said morning. Yeah, that was not to the level that I usually. And it didn't make the pain worse. OK, that's, I find that reassuring, actually. OK, OK. Have you eaten or drinking anything today? No. When's the last time? Last night. And you said the pain's here and kind of travels up your knees up. Does it go all the way to your neck or does it just kind of sit in the chest? So it starts here. Over here. I'd say it's gone as high as a year. And it's sharp. Does it go through the back? It has, but not as OK, maybe worse. With deep breaths. They asked me that earlier, so not right now. Yeah. Yeah. Hard to focus on other things when the pain's so bad. It makes sense. And I wasn't. I was like, I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. OK. And positionally laying down was worse, but nothing. Was it made better by leaning forward? Not necessarily. So I because I tried that, and it made it worse, too. OK. Have you been sick recently? No, I did. I have been working with my doctor in the last month or so. As I started, I had a little bad shirt on that right lower on the right lower. So I did. Then my entire stomach was cold. Transfusion, emergency recess #3. So that she brought me on pantoprazole. Yeah. Yeah. And it's helped, I would say, on the last week. That was actually really good. OK, That's good. Yeah. And nothing like this has happened before, except the gallbladder feels kind of similar. Feels similar. Yeah. And the gallbladder without wet when? 22 years ago. Oh, goodness. Yeah. That's what I have, my daughter, but I just. I remember that pain. Yeah. They said it was probably worse than labor. Kind of feeling the same to me. OK. And you've had all of the abdominal imaging already? Quite recently. Yeah. Like 2 weeks ago. OK. Yeah. So they did. Where was that done in Fergus? That makes sense. I can't see much on your because I'm not from here. I'm just here visiting. Yeah, yeah. So they did specifically the Mendex the first time, and then the second time they did like the mail area. Have you ever had any scopes? Like to work through the talk? Any changes to your bowels? No. Are you regular every day? Yeah. So because I don't have gallbladder, I had diarrhea for 18 years. Oh, my goodness. Yeah, the doctor kept telling me yes. And then I got a new Doctor and she was like, no, that's because you don't have a gallbladder to take this, and it's fixed. OK, So yeah, So yes, Now the one thing the doctor had said with my stomach was to start trying Metamucils, because I didn't know. So I haven't had anything to sleep, but I was taking and left cell movement today, yesterday, no blood and no black. And you didn't vomit? You just feel nauseous? No, I did, like nothing came up. No. Do you have a cough? Not really. Like I've coughed a couple of times and when the chest pain came on, it sounds like it kind of had a grumbly start and ramped up. Yeah, it does definitely help. Yeah. And maybe it's now subsiding a little. Is it anything in the left shoulder or arm? No. Were you really sweaty when it started or when it got worse? No, I just any dizziness? I was a little bit dizzy this morning. Did you? You didn't? No. Falls. Any changes to your vision? Headaches. And you normally have migraines? Yeah. I get any shortness of breath? No. OK. And no pain in the belly right now? No. OK. And you're not? Are you feeling weak anywhere? No. No. I would say a little tired. Yeah. But were you able to sleep? I am a terrible sleeper to start with so it's hard. So did you wake up from sleep with pain? No, it was actually pretty good overnight and yesterday or the day before. Any changes to your habits like eating, drinking? Like you didn't have 3 bottles of wine or a bunch of take out or anything like that? Well, we've been eating at restaurants all because you've been here. Yeah. Yeah. So like I said, Tuesday night we went to the stuff with it, but not like a whole bunch of greasy foods or alcohol or anything like that. No, I I don't drink. Really. OK. I only ask this sometimes. This kind of pain, it could be heart, heart chest related. In your case, it doesn't super sound like it right now. And your testing so far has been reassuring. The electrical test we did on your heart with all the stickers was normal, and the tripleman, which is the enzyme that tells your heart's working really hard, was also normal. So that's reassuring. But the place you're describing it, I mean, it could be the reflux, it could be that. But then sometimes when it's right around here, we also think about other organs, gallbladder, which you don't have, or pancreas. And so I'm asking questions that would maybe induce pancreatitis. Yeah. OK. Have you ever had pancreatitis before? OK OK. Now, I don't know if this match or not, when it's hurting, it's literally like I have, it feels like there's something to start, like I want to or I want to or I want to just move something. Yeah, it is sounding a lot like reflex to me. But again, I, I think that's something that we decide on once we rule everything else out because there's more, more dangerous things, of course. OK. And you didn't, you didn't choke on anything or swallow anything all or anything like that. OK. Because that would be kind of silly of me not to ask, I suppose. OK sounds good. And, and do you have any family history of any heart issues? How old? They don't have strokes. Mom was actually. Dad had stroke issues. And no back pain, Right. Just very intermittent. Yeah. Yeah. And it doesn't feel like a tearing from the chest into the back. You're going to be torn apart. No. OK. Like I said, it's mostly sharp and traveling up and down. Does it hurt when you touch it? Yeah, Sorry. It's the IV. I thought you tell us it was the IV or your chest that was. Oh, no, it's the IV is right. But I can't find my. Does it hurt if I touch right here? Does that make it worse? It's tender, but it doesn't send shooting pains or anything. And I know when I was working with the doctor, she touched that top part. And that's where it gets worse. Yeah. And here, right now, it's OK. And how about right here? Is this where it hurts? Yeah, it's probably called the epigastric region, but it's a little odd. Nothing in the chest, but like I said, it's actually what is it at the 10 right now. OK, OK, good. Yeah, that's good. So I don't know whether the games that's helps take me a job. Possibly you need to go listen to your heart doctor. I don't know when I'm supposed to give this back to them. Mostly done our history, but I think we'll leave it because sometimes I ask questions as it is. I'm sorry, that was me. Big breath in. Well, I'm glad that it seems to be resolving. No clear triggers for it. I'm just kind of when you laid back down, I did wonder that it was a bit of a test. I'm sorry it was a mean test, but I think it's in support of it being refluxed because usually it does get worse when you lie down. OK, but I'm going to review your blood work and chat with one of my colleagues. I'm a resident so she's stuck and I'll chat it over with her and see if there's anything else she thinks that we might be wanting to add. I guess not. Doesn't pair with deep breaths. You're not short of breath. Any calf tenderness or pain? And you're dancing from Fergus. So you drove? It's like a few hours, right? Five hours. Five hours. When did you drive? Sunday. Are you on vacation? Yeah. A friend of mine is here, working, moving. So she asked me to tag along. So. And you're spending your day here? Yeah. Sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. So we can go to the spot because we used to come here and go, but we haven't been in a while. So she said they're going to take a long. It's so lovely, so nice. Yeah. We. Yeah. So. Yeah. So we're going home tomorrow. So I was trying to wait, but this morning it was just so bad. But I'm glad you came in. I think that it's chest pain's not something to ignore. Agreed. OK, I'm going to go and chat with one of the other docs in the right back. OK. Any questions for you right now? No, I guess the only question is if it is acid reflux, like I'm just curious why? Yeah, I agree. It's the thing that's kind of counting against me. But how how much did you take of the So the I took last night, I took 2 tablets of fuzzy yeah or something and it might have happened a little bit and then it definitely took away. I took a couple of times yesterday. This morning I took two and also then two more times and it might have helped a little, but not very much. It took maybe took the Gavestop didn't do anything this morning. Yeah, I bought some Pepcid because that was the only thing they had. But I found a full mag process and they said don't take it, but no. Yeah. Pantoprazole. Yeah, Sorry. Because it's the same thing. Yeah. So I didn't take it. OK. And do you take the pantoprazole once a day in the morning? Yeah. So I had been taking it twice a day because it was. Yeah, You know, because my stomach was only there trying to relax. When did you stop taking it twice a day? Last week. I moved to once a day. Yeah, the last week. Let me have a think about it. I think that I think that as long as we have a a live face like a pancreas, and I need to rule out information here, you're not very tender. We don't think I'm suspicious for a party at 'cause based on how they're presenting, I think that would be my best guess. But I'm going to make sure. OK. All right, I will be back. Is it OK to drink some water? Yeah, I would love if you could drink the water. That would be very reassuring. Thank you so much. No problem. I wasn't sure when to give it back to you."

         "With her recording. Oh, I'm no problem at all. None at all. OK, can you just confirm your name for me? My name is Mary Barker. Great. December 7, 1952. OK, awesome. I'm one of the emergency doctors here. OK, so I was having to read about you. I know you have the lung cancer. Is the cancer just in the lungs or is it? Has it moved anywhere else? Umm, it's just stayed here. OK. I just finished radiation treatment. I'm starting again on Thursday. OK 'cause one of the spots, like he got rid of two, but there's two small ones that he thought were growing, so he's going to go through. OK. And when was your most recent radiation treatment? How many days ago? Umm, oh, it's a couple of weeks now. A couple weeks ago. OK. And then you're coming in because of some chest pain, is that correct? Yeah. It's like almost like a pulled muscle here, but it's radiating to the back. So it's across both sides of the chest, like the lower chest. Yeah, here. OK. Basically this side, this side isn't it's just the left side, just the left side and it, it shoots to the left side as well. Yeah, in the back. OK, yeah. And have you ever had pain like this before? No, this feels different. OK, This feels different. Feels different than your like radiation type of pain if you've ever had it before. Yeah, It, it feels different than uh. OK Could you describe it? Is it like sharp burning, aching, throbbing? It's like a throbbing. It's almost like, you know, when you get a bruise and you tuck. Yeah. It's like, ow, OK. Yeah, OK. And it doesn't radiate to your neck, jaw or nothing like that. No, not at all. OK, so a throbbing pain and sorry. When did you first experience it? Was it yesterday? It it's a couple of days ago. It's OK. It just sort of at first I thought, oh, I pulled a muscle. Yeah. Do you didn't injure yourself recently. Like no trauma. You haven't been doing activity where you could pull the pull the muscle. No, no. So it's been about two days. Is the pain been constant for the two days or coming and going? It's like, is it always there or it's always there? But it's like when I lay down or sit down, it really becomes hard. Like when you lay down flat on your back. Flat. Yeah. I can't. Like, I What about if you're, like twisting, bending? Does that kind of movement make it worse? Yeah. Yeah. So worse with movement, worse with laying down. Do you feel like the pain intensity is worse when you take a big breath in? Do you feel more intense? Yes. OK, Yeah. I'm going to ask you a couple other yes or no questions. Any fevers in the last few days? Mild. Like, not to the point where? Oh, my God. You know, like, I just like you're feeling more. Yeah. But you haven't measured your temperature. No, I haven't. Any chills or sweats? Some chills, no sweats. OK. So feeling warm at times, chilled other times over the last few days. Yeah. OK. Yeah. Any nausea or vomiting in the last few days? No. OK. No. No diarrhea? No. Any new cough symptoms since my radiation treatment? Yeah, and I've quit smoking also. OK. When did you quit smoking? It's a month. Oh, congratulations. It's hard. That's great. I developed like, when I start to cough, it's like it really hurts. So my idea why didn't I first get worried about it? It's like, because I'm coughing so much, maybe I pulled a muscle. OK, so you've been coughing more since your radiation treatment. Yes. OK. But in the last couple days, you don't have a new cough. You're not spitting blood up or any mucus? No, just mucus is coming up. And that's your standard. Yeah. And that's been for a few weeks. OK. And, umm, any shortness of breath or trouble breathing in the last few days? No. OK. Any new swelling in the bottom of your legs? Umm, or pain or redness there? No, no, no. Everything seems. Any dizziness or fainting spells? No, just a little weak 'cause it's it's hard to eat, OK, Since I started the radiation, it can't. But you haven't been feeling dizzy or woozy? No. Any heart flutters or palpitations? No. OK. And I'm just going to feel your legs here. No tenderness? No. And this side? No. OK. Have you ever had a blood clot before or needed a blood thinner medication? No. OK. Are you on any hormone therapy like estrogen or anything like that? OK. And you said you're getting your next radiation later this week. Yes. OK, I'm going to get you to lean forward. You're not on any not on any chemo or anything like that? No, no, just the radiation. Any recent surgeries in the last three months? No. OK, big breath. Out again and out. OK, And then that hurt a little bit. That's hurting there. OK, I'm just going to close this. Do you mind taking your cardigan off? Oh, logging, please. OK. And you said nothing's actually hurt your chest that you can remember. No, no. Hold your breath. Good. And then lean forward again and breathe normal and the big ones in through the mouth and out. OK. And then I just want to take a look to see if there's any rash on your chest. That's OK. Sure. No problem at all so the pains kind of along this area yeah. OK I'm just gonna feel that tender at all yeah a little tender on the left side yeah yeah. OK, you can pull your And then you said increase cough for the last few weeks. Yeah, but that I like. I talked to the doctor. He said that'll happen when you're quitting smoking 'cause you're little thingies there. It's like, oh, oh, look, we can. Yeah, you know, see. Have you been coughing like a lot like throughout the day since? Yeah, a lot. OK, so in terms of next steps, so far, your blood work looks OK. Your chest X-ray is pretty much unchanged. There is maybe near kind of where your blood vessels meet your lungs. There's a little bit more like kind of prominence of those areas, but it's not really specific for anything. But there's no signs of a new infection, OK. This might just be your muscles in between your ribs are sore because you've been coughing. But because you do have the cancer, I want to make sure you don't have a blood clot, OK? OK. So we're going to do a scan of your chest to see, OK OK. Have you had any recent CAT scans like in the last month or two, probably longer. Oh, from that think I, I think I have, I'm not. OK, I'll double check your chart. But yeah, we're, I'm going to add on a blood test and then, OK, we might end up adding on the test, like the CT scan, just sending other blood tests. No. So your blood's already been taken. OK, Yeah, we don't have to poke you again. It's just adding on to what's already been cut off. OK Umm. But we're going to make sure that's the dangerous thing we want to rule out. OK. If it's negative, then we can kind of chalk it up to probably this is just some sore muscles from all the coughing. OK, OK, sounds good. That's what I thought it might be, but it got to the point where couldn't even lay down. Yeah, no, for sure. But we're going to make sure we rule. OK, That in the meantime, I'll get you to grab your items and you can just wait in room 20 until, umm, they're ready to do anymore tests. OK. OK. Sounds good. Take your time. And then just room 20 on that side. OK. OK. OK. All right. Thank you. Thank you. OK, thank you. Yeah, no problem."

         "Can I start or? Yeah. OK. All right. Tell me what happened. What brought you here to the hospital? Since yesterday? A little bit. A day before. Yeah. Yesterday. It was at the beginning. I have a chest pain. Whereabouts. Here. OK. And so here. OK. Have you ever had pain like this before? Like those? My English is not that good, but that's OK. A few months ago, multiple times. I have like, like warnings like that. Not that pain. Is there anything that you do that makes the pain better or worse? Smoking maybe? Smoking. How about breathing? Taking a breath in maybe? Yeah, I've been when I'm OK. Do you cough? Are you coughing? No, if I cough. Any fever or chills? Yesterday 19. You had some fevers last night. Were you sick recently with a cough or a cold? Last couple weeks? Runny nose, Nothing. OK. How high was your fever yesterday? I didn't check, but like you just felt like like that. All right. Do you have any medical problems? No. Are you on any regular medications? I check melatonin to melatoninously. All right. And any travel recently? Travel. Have you traveled out of the country? Has anybody even sick around you? No. Can I have a listen to your heart and lungs? Yes. Let's start with your lungs. Nice deep breath in sore when I push down. Is there one spot that sore right there when I push? Is that the same pain that you're feeling a little bit and down here? No, no, just right up, right over here. I look at your heart tracing. It looks very normal. Yes. So the pain that you're having here, that one spot, I think it's inflammation of the cartilage that connects the bones together, your sternum and your wrist right there. So if that gets inflamed, it can cause pain, especially if you're breathing or if you're coughing, if you're moving. It's all the muscles that are inter interrelated I would imagine. So there's not a lot that we need to. Your lungs sound very clear. There's no signs of pneumonia on when I listen to the lungs. So the airs might lose in and out very nicely. So what I would recommend is just taking some Tylenol, some Advil, give it a couple of days, it should go away on itself. That's it, that's it. But if you say start getting more persistent high fever, if you're coughing a lot of things, you're coughing up a lot of phlegm, getting a lot of sweats at night or during the day, and if you're chilled, then come back, we'll do an X-ray to make sure you don't have it all in the act right now. I don't think so. I think it's just the inflammation of the cartilage that's there. And Tylenol Advil should fix that. OK, thank you. Perfect. Happy to hear that. OK, any questions for me? No, thank you so much. No problem. Have a good day. Have a good day. Thanks. And if you have time I want to send you like a questions."

         "Hi, How are you? Good, good. I'm Jesse. I'm investing a Med student on the documentary person working together Today. So I read the notes from the triage nurses. Sounds like you're having some palpitations. Interesting. Yeah. Do you want to tell me the story? Yeah. So. Well, it goes back a little way, right. So like, for a few months, I've been feeling very, like, exhausted, but kind of beyond the beyond, you know, like everything just feels very OK. Like even just to do a chore, I have to do it and then rest and take a shower and rest. That's my yeah, I haven't had that before. And in the past couple of months, Yeah. So it's been maybe like maybe four months of like, feeling like that, but around two months of having these strange kind of help patients. So it's like definitely feels like fluttering in my chest. Not sure. Like, you know, kind of what it is, right? They they, they dissipate, usually accompanied by some Lightheadedness and nausea, Right. And so that's been happening for a bit. And, you know, I just haven't been feeling great. Just don't know what it is. Yeah, I doctor ordered a halter monitor. Your family doctor? Yes, my, my 2P, Yeah. So she ordered a halter monitor. She had that one last week. Yeah. Come out. Yeah. So I did it Monday. Yeah, the 30th, yeah, three days. And she ordered a battery of like a blood test, right. That's a kind of extracting point. So when like I can see the blood test, right? So everything looked normal except for my A1C, which was at the point of diabetes. So it's possible that, you know, could distribute some of the feelings. I had a strong family history, right? And there's also a very strong family history of heart disease and both parents died of my mother died of diabetes and heart disease and my father died of heart disease. So again, not sure what the fluttering is like. It goes away and I hadn't had any pain up to that point. This morning I went to work and went to work early and I started to feel very nauseated, vomited and and then got wrapped up here like just not feeling great. I had last night was like a odd night. I woke up and I woke up to those palpations like it kind of woke me up. Didn't feel great this morning, but didn't feel to be honest that different overall. So but then the vomiting and and then I started to have pain around like around 6 30 this morning, I started to have like pain in my shoulder blade. OK, so so you're having palpitations for the past couple months and then you're saying that last night was your last episode of palpitations. That's the last time you had what? When did it come on? Last night about 3:00 in the morning, like woke you up from your sleep and same kind of deal where it was racing and then you felt a bit dizzy, like headed. You didn't faint at all. No, no, no. How long do they last for before they go away? About a minute, 2 minutes. Like 2 minutes long. Like they're not. How often do they come on? Well, I was having them quite frequently. And then. And what does that mean when I say, like every few days? Every few days? Once every few days, yeah. And then I didn't have any for a while. And then when I did the halter monitor, I was like really hopeful wait, 'cause I wanted to capture it. I had a bit of that right in the beginning. Yeah, but no dizziness and no nausea, but just a bit of the fluttering. But it went away right away, like just a few seconds. So you're having palpitations once every couple days. Yeah. And they last for a couple minutes and go away. Yeah. Has that frequency stayed the same over the past two months? What? Sort of. Yeah. Like it comes in more or less. Yeah. Yeah. So last thing was your last episode. We'll get from your sleep, but you're a bit dizzy. But you didn't faint at all. Went back to sleep. Yeah. And then this morning. Yeah. What happened this morning? Not great. Woke up feeling a bit nauseous. Yeah, nauseous. But I've been feeling nauseous, like, you know, on the way. Yeah. What do you mean by that? Well, like you had nausea before. So I've had nausea for. So when I had my cancer treatment, I had a lot of nausea. I was on an anti like back in 2017. Yeah, OK. I, I'm still on the enormous ACE inhibitor and I still have some nausea from that. So I was on a anti nausea medication and my doctor was concerned about tardive dyskinesia, so I stopped taking it. But the I've had it like I've I've. So this is long saying nausea. Yeah. So that's what you woke up with this morning was not out of the norm for you? Well, it it was in the sense that I don't usually vomit. OK. And you have one episode of vomiting today. Today. OK Bloody at all green at all? No, no, no. It's just like vile. I didn't eat anything. I haven't eaten yesterday. I didn't feel well. I didn't eat dinner and I had like a late lunch. OK, so you vomited, feeling nauseous. And then when did the chest pain start? Around 6:30. So what time did you, what time was this when you woke up and you had the nausea About 3:30 in the morning? Yeah, the, the the palpitations were about 3:30. And then I went back to sleep, woke up in the morning not feeling great. And then, you know, took a shower. I thought, like, I felt a little bit of discomfort. So the 3/30 was when the nausea was also happening. Yes. When you woke up from publications, it was you're also nauseous when you vomit. But the vomit, no, the vomiting was this morning at at 7:00, at six. OK. So then when you woke up at six, Yeah, you were having some chest pain. Yeah. Where was the pain? So it's the like that, that in the back like that, nothing else. But the bone went around there and it, it, I can feel it. Yeah. Like inside. OK, it's, and then I feel like a pressure, my pressure here and some pain there. Do you feel like it's traveling there or it's just two separate areas of pain? I I think it's traveling. I'm not 100%. And it came on at six today. What were you doing when it came on? Nothing. Like I just, I was just getting up. It came on upon like just waking up like all of a sudden all at once or it was kind of there, like it was there. Like I felt like, I thought initially that my, like I slept wrong, you know, my back was hurting. OK. It just got a little bit worse and it's been getting worse. Yeah. And I just felt OK. And how would you describe it? Like squeezing? It feels more like dull, sharp, dull. And like, I want, I want to say like deep, but it's like dull. OK. Like, yeah. Gotcha. Yeah. And it's constant or it comes and goes constant. Any sweatiness with that? No, I haven't had any sweatiness with that. OK. But you're still having that ongoing nausea. OK. And then any heart racing with that as well. I've had the heart racing so around 3 I felt yeah other than that, yeah, none today. Okay, had it since any trouble breathing? So I have asthma and I had COVID in the beginning of September, and I had on kindness, right? So my breathing's not 100, like 100%, but I don't feel like I'm like, like gasping for air. And from your baseline, do you feel like it's significantly worse today or no? Just around the state. OK Yeah. Pain here. Worse at all with any exertion. A little bit when I was walking, you know, like, it was a bit worse. It felt like I just felt a little overwhelmed. I kind of that feeling. So I'm not sure if it was like, OK, but that feeling got you OK. And then worse with taking a deep breath. No, no, it's all the same. Like it's just there. OK. And what about worse when you lie flat at all? So when I'm laying flat, I don't really. Like, I didn't. I haven't done it since. Yeah. But like, it's not like it's terrible when you lie flat and gets better when staying up. OK. OK. And then recently, have you noticed any like increased swelling in your legs and belly? So I've had some tenderness in my in my belly, right. Nothing like, you know, like nothing like a stomach. It doesn't feel like a stomach ache, but tenderness I haven't had, I had a little bit, I would say my feet are a little bit swollen. You think your feet are more a little bit, but nothing major, Right. Right. And you said you're like kind of tolerance or activity has decreased over the past four months. Yeah. Do you get any chest pain or trouble breathing with that? Trouble breathing and just like extreme fatigue. Fatigue. Yeah. OK. Do you have any trouble breathing when you lie flat? It's not really not really trouble breathing. I try to sleep with a little bit of an incline, but it's been pretty well the same. I don't feel like I get like a full like, I don't feel like I I get full breath. Yeah. But I is that something that's worsening over the past four months, though? Like, yeah, over the last. But I've had COVID and I had, you know, so do you wake up in the middle of the night just gasping for air? I know you have sleep apnea, but do you, do you still? I still have sleep apnea, yeah. Do you wake up in the middle of the night gasping for air? Not gasping for air. I know. OK. No, right. And you're not on any water pills or any diuretics. No, I'm just on like a low dose of sorry, rivaroxamine. Yeah, well, the like a blood thinner anti. Yeah. I'll get to your medicine Just a second. I just have more questions for you. So any like swelling in one of the legs at all? No. Or tenderness in the leg? No, I don't. I know you have a history. Yeah, I don't think I have a clause. And you're on the daily rivaroxaban. Yeah. And that's not that was a more of a my. So the the hematologist put me on it as a precaution measure because of the aromatase inhibitor. Yeah. Because I've had that history before. And you haven't missed any doses in your blood thinners? Hey. No. And no recent long flights or surgeries. No, you're not coughing up. I sit at my desk a lot, but OK. But yeah, you're not coughing up blood. No. OK. You said you haven't fainted at all. No, I haven't fainted. I felt very dizzy. But you didn't. Yeah. And then other than the breast cancer in 2017, No. No recurrence or no other cancers in the past six months? No. Yeah. OK, OK. And then otherwise any like cough, cold, congestion type symptoms recently just the COVID and then how long ago was the COVID? This is the beginning of September and September. OK, first like the end of the like a month ago. OK, yeah. Any recent fever chills? I I don't have it. I haven't had a fever, but I have felt cold like, you know, like kind of chilled, right. But I haven't like, not like shaking or anything like that. But definitely there's no recent illness. You felt pretty OK otherwise. Yeah. Well, I mean, other than feeling like it's this, it's the fatigue and that like, like everything feels like it weighs a lot, you know, like, and I have like brain fog. It's it's really weird. I don't like, I had some problems with my thyroid, like many years ago. It kind of felt like that and like how I felt when I was on chemo. OK. I feel that, like, yeah, like you feel achy. You feel OK, you know, just unwell. And how long has that been going? Is that since like, the four months as well? OK. Any tummy pain? Like I said, I have tenderness. Like, where is the tenderness? So here, up here and more on the side, yeah, but definitely here too. But definitely here like comes and goes or constant it. It's there constantly for the past how long? I don't know, like six months, six months. The doctor had, you know, kind of palpated it and looked at it. The only other things that have happened that like they're not. So I had. So I have a shoulder, like a lot of pain in the shoulder. I'd say like pretty well always around an 8, seven or eight in the shoulder. It looks like it's a tear, right? Like partial tear. And they like so. And then in August, I had pushed the door open and I heard a really loud cracking noise right at my ribs. The doctor had an X-ray. It doesn't look like they're, you know, 'cause there's like cancer reoccurring. That oncologist had told me that I have a high chance of it coming back between the five and 10 year mark. So she, you know, investigated. But that's again like that didn't seem to be like a metastasis. So like, so is this pain similar to the pain you had with your rib stuff? No, this is different abdominal pain that you've been having for the past couple months. Just the tenderness. But it could be also, it could be the, you know, anastrozole too. Like it kind of gives you that muscle, like, you know, OK. Achiness, OK. Worse at all after meals. No. And you're having regular bowel movements. Yeah. Yeah. Any like today I had diarrhea. OK, OK. But no, like black Terry stools, no. Bright red blood stools, no. Any heartburn? Yes, but I'm on you are taking a PPI for it. Yeah. OK, OK. And then in terms of these palpitations that have been ongoing for the past four months, you've never had palpitations before? Many years ago, I had some palpitations that explored it. OK. Then there was something. And then you said you had issues with your thyroid previously. Were you hyperthyroid, hypothyroid, hypo, hypo. Are you still taking anything? No, so it was weird. I had blood clots and I had the PE, right. And after that I had some problems with my thyroid. They had put me on thyroid medication and then they took me off and everything seemed to resolve. They weren't sure why. Do you know if your family doctor are on thyroid tests for you? You can probably see them in my chart, OK, which he just ordered. OK OK, because I can see them in my chart. OK And then any recent. So other than the COVID you had mentioned, no other recent infections precipitating these episodes. OK And then just one more thing. Any like caffeine? I do drink coffee. Yeah. How much? So like one or two cups a day. Yeah. And that's been your baseline for a while? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah. And I've gone to, like, decaf, so. Yeah. OK. Any like stimulant use? No, I don't take any drugs. I don't take any recreational drugs. I don't know smoke any alcohol like maybe once a month or so, but completely otherwise, yeah. And then in terms of the medications to take, so you said vermaroxaban. Otherwise you're taking the medicine for your breast cancer. Yeah. Any other regular meds with the PPI and the so I'm taking the Dexilant for my, you know, for my stomach, right. I'm taking the what can I say in the box of blood I have I'm taking cholesterol medication. I'm taking anti like to lower my blood pressure and and then the blood thick. OK, sounds good and no recent antibiotic use. No. So how are you feeling now? Not feeling great. Like I mean the like she gave me some pain medication. I like you know, it's like what symptoms are you having now? So I still feel the pain. I feel a bit of pressure this like left sided and then the back. OK, I still feel that. I don't feel any palpitations. OK. I still feel not like a bit of nausea. Yeah. And I just feel tired. OK. OK. And sorry. Remind me, is the pain in this chest here constant or does it come in gold? It's constant. OK, I'll still listen to you. Here. Take some deep breaths. In and out. Do you feel like the pain is getting worse over time or is it all the same with your bags here? And you said prior to this, no history of chest pain when you're exerting yourself? No, just kind of shortness of breath and fatigue that's been going on slide down for me here. Feel your belly. Actually, can you show me where's the pain in the chest so I can feel like a pressure here. Yeah. And here. Like I like. Yeah. Under there, inside here. And then where my, you know where the backbone is? Yeah. Does it hurt when I press? It really hurts when you press. It hurts. Yeah. I, I want a lot of tenderness. Yeah. The other. And that's, that's reproducing the pain that you're having. No, that that pain is normal. I've had that since the chemotherapy. Isn't that so it feels different from the pain that you have right now? Yeah, 100% that hurts. Does this also feel like the pain that you're having, or is this also different? It's a bit different. This is like your long standing pain. OK, I have to take a look here. Feel your belly. Yeah, that really hurts. That hurts. Yeah. Does it hurt everywhere? No or no? Just like, like there, like as we get closer to be here. Yeah, that's right. Can you lower your. Yeah. What was this from? C-section and the hysterectomy and my ovaries were OK, like later after my breast cancer diagnosis. When was your last bowel movement? Like what I got here. Yeah, Where's the worst pain? When I was when you're pressing, it's like on the both sides up here on this side. This side yeah hurts worse. Do you still have your appendix? Yeah. Do you still have your gallbladder? No, took your gallbladder on me. So just relax here. Any pain there? It hurts when you press Yeah, but it's it's not like a yeah there. It's there. But and remind me, when does the stomach pain been starting? The stomach pain has been there for like months, like two months more than that. Oh yeah, that hurts. That hurts. Anything like tap there? Not really, no. Like take a deep breath in and out and out. Does that cause pain? Take a deep breath in and out and out pain. Any pain in the back here? No, no, no. Is my kidneys or anything like that tender there? Yeah, and tender here. If I shake you like this? If you shake me, Doesn't really other than No, No. But so it sounds like pain here. Pain here. And then paint your hands. Yeah, That's like between here. No, but like here your. Yes, right there. Is it. Is it worse on this side here? No, it's worse on this side. Yeah. OK, OK. Sit up for me. Sit down. Sorry. Actually, I'm going to look at your legs. OK. Yeah. I, I just noticed my ankles are a little bit, you know, like swollen, but nothing like, you know, bizarre, but definitely. And they feel a little bit swollen, you know, like, but it definitely doesn't feel like it did when I had the clot, like when I had the clot, right. It feels like I was going to lose my going, like the pain was so bad. Yeah. And it presented I like I had it twice, right. So yeah, they think it's connected. So they think it's connected to estrogen, Yes, which is quite. Yeah. And Doctor Karadic. Yeah. So there's probably some form of probabilia, but he says it's not detective like they weren't able to detect it. Is there a pain when I press it's, you know, like, I mean, it is it is it reproducing? No, it's not reproducing. The pain is just there. OK, bring your arms up and down like that. Does that cause any pain for you? Well, you know, the shoulder, but nothing in terms of this. And take a deep breath in and out and out. And that doesn't reproduce the pain either. No, just there. So OK, let me just recap quickly. So sounds like you're coming in with some chest pain and some nausea, vomiting, kind of on that left side here, nausea, vomiting since last night. You also had an episode of some palpitations last night. That's a couple minutes dizzy, but nothing else. And then right now you're still having this ongoing chest pain or like just, I guess, heaviness that doesn't seem to go away. It's not getting worse when you like, exercise or exert yourself at all. But it's new, guys. Like I said, I just noticed it. Yeah, a little bit more when I was walking, but like, this takes a lot of effort to, you know, like I feel like I like. Yeah, a lot of effort to, you know, never had it before. But you've been having some palpitations in the past two months. OK. OK. Sounds good. So I'll just have you hang tight here. I'm going to go back. I'm just going to review your your blood work on the things you did. OK. I'll go grab Doctor Dewhurst and we'll come back and talk about a plan. OK. OK. OK. Great. Yeah. Thanks too. Thanks. I'm just going to run to the washroom. Yeah, absolutely right."

         "Thank you so much. Perfect. OK, so I'm Doctor Travra. So tell me what's going on to bring in. Well, uh, I've been having really, really shortness of breath. OK, So like, yeah. And it comes, it goes. But here's the thing. When, when I say that for about 3 years, I've been taking all kinds of nasal sprays because my, my, my passages and nasals get really, really stuffed up. They, they don't, there's nothing there. There's something wrong with my nose, something that OK. And had you needed to see a surgeon or like, well, you know what? I've, I've asked, I've asked a few times what we should do. And they go, well, let's try this spray. And it's like, OK, three months of that spray and it's like, oh, that's not working. Let's try this one. And it's like, it's always like a new spray. OK, keep trying, but this has been going on for a couple of years, a couple of years. And I, I recently started one of those machines, those APAP machines. Sorry, say it the APAP machine for sleep apnea, for sleep apnea and want me to take that all the time. So I've been taking that, but I've found that I'm, I've like, the more I take, I don't know if it's related, like if it's just happened at the same time, but I've been getting a hard time breathing, a really hard time catching my breath. Interesting. And when that happens, I get pain right in my chest. Like it just builds up. It'll go away. Yeah. And then it'll come back and it'll go away and it'll come back. Is there anything that brings it back on? I, I, I don't think so. You know, I, I, I started a new job and honestly at 60, I didn't want to do that. So there's a little bit of anxiety there. I have been. What is the job? I, I, I went from machinery to shipping. I really didn't want to, but I didn't have much of A choice. Got you, You know, so there's a little bit of anxiety there because I was never trained properly, right? You know, do you feel like there's panic or anxiety that there's a little bit I, I, I have, I, the only really medical condition I have is I have OCD. I've had it my whole life, understand. And so it's possible that it's activated that and it's just all an anxiety thing or something like that. Yeah. But yeah. So. So today I was just at work and I was feeling pretty bad. My boss told me I had to come here. Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah. I think it's actually quite reasonable given like, this is a kind of a new symptom for you. Yeah, so let's just kind of go through a few more symptoms. When these breathing episode comes on, because you say it comes on and off on and on. How long would it come on for? Is there? Oh, sometimes it'd be any anywhere between 20 minutes and 40 minutes. OK. And then it goes and it goes away. Well, it doesn't fully go away. It's like, it's like all of a sudden it's like holding your nose and then getting like 10% of your lung power. Like you're constantly just going, like, I just can't get in there. You get incredibly tired. Yeah, sometimes dizzy. But The thing is, is that I forgot to tell you, I also take prostate medication because I have a large property, but I'm 60, so. Yeah, and they did tell me that the medication that I was on also causes, you know, dizziness. Dizziness. Yeah. But shouldn't cause shortness of breath though. No, they, they didn't say anything about shortness of breath. But as far as the dizziness went, I went, OK. Well, I don't know if that's this or part of the medication or what, what it is. What about if you're like, doing activities, like if you're exerting yourself walking around, do you feel like you're more short of breath during that time? Sometimes a little bit. I I ride. I quit smoking about 15 years ago. OK. Yeah, really. Tried to get back into shape. I lost like 60 lbs. I go to the gym great. About 3 * a week. I ride my bike to work. Great. Yeah. And sometimes when I'm riding, I can go like, wow, I should not be out of this. I used to do this very easily. Would you say that it's like, are you able? So do you ride your bike daily then? Yeah, every day. Let's say that you're getting onto your bike, right. Do you find that it's consistent that every time you're riding your bike you feel short of breath for that time? OK, so it's not consistent with activity. Something. No. Ever with pain? Chest pain? No. OK. And then no passing out episodes then? No. Any swelling onto your legs that you notice? I don't think so. Do you feel short of breath at night? So you're waking up gasping for her? There have been a few times where I've had to RIP the machine off because I'm. I'm got choking. OK. And yeah, I don't know, maybe it's the machine. I don't. No, no, no. It's it's I I don't know what it is. You've never had any heart troubles before? No. Have you ever had any testing for any heart issues? No. OK. Do you have a family option? I have a doctor. I I have it. It's just that like, I like when you came in, we did heart tracing for you, an X-ray and some blood work. Nothing. All normal so the heart tracing shows no problems with the electricity, the chest X-ray shows that the lung structure looks fine and then the blood work looks for a couple of things one for signs of like mini heart attack or heart stress strain and that's a negative test. Also another test they did is to screen for blood clots which the main symptom is shortness of breath and that's a negative test as well. Actually all of your testing looks pretty normal so far. So you're saying it's more than likely the anxiety? Yeah, I think that it's actually a really a big possibility. But here's the thing. I don't love that you're kind of like getting to 60 and developing this shortness of breath all of a sudden. So I do think that I can make a note to your doctor, but maybe considering getting a heart ultrasound. So that looks for the structure of the heart, right? Would probably be a reasonable thing. I don't think you need to urgently get it right now. Like it's not like, you know, please call your doctor immediately, but I think booking that appointment for some follow up with the consideration of getting a heart ultrasound, which is a note I'll make on your chart would be a reasonable thing to do to just say, I'm sorry. I just, I was just going to say just structurally kind of say like, OK, at least the heart is functioning fine and we've addressed those. And then if it, if that's all normal, then yes, considering like anxiety as a diagnosis would be very reasonable. Is there anything it could be so thing in my head to be causing anything done just on because when when I like I have one of those machines that that yeah, that is and and and literally like it's supposed to be like 99 to 100. My brother puts it on, it's 99. My friend puts it on, it's 99. I put it on and it's 87. Like it wasn't 87 when you came in though it. No, but that's what I mean. It jumped sometimes from like 87 to to goes back to like 98. Yeah. But sometimes it gets really low. It's a little tricky for me to say because there there is, yes, the number, but it's kind of like how what is the quality of that number at that time? Because even our machines here, it shows, it gives us a measure of quality. It's like a little graph to show the quality of it. And sometimes it takes a bit to register a proper number. So I hear that like, you know, other people getting 90 nines on it. But if it's not getting a a proper quality reading, which some people just don't have the same sort of like it's going to take a second to register it. I have crappy skin. Yeah. So it's very possible it might just be like a registration error as long as you're also getting numbers that are 9899. OK. OK. I think that would be fine. I'm not sure what to do for that. I just want to take a listen to you though. OK. Oh, I left this over here. Give me one second."

         "Thank you. Hello. Hi, It's Sonia. Yes, hi. My name is Jeff Perry, one of the emergency doctors. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. All right, so I've heard a little bit about what's been going on. I'd send you here for some chest discomfort and mostly chest, but and I've seen some of your results, so maybe you can just tell me in your own words what's going on. Just make sure I have the right information. Sure. I go to bed at 10 and usually I wake up around 2:00 or 4:00 and then I can't even turn because I feel like I've got advice around my chest. I'm in pain. So I barely make it to the back to the bathroom. I and then going back to bed is like painful. It's like especially laying on my back, it's even worse. So I lay on my side. Then at 7 I, I get tired of it, I go take a shower, a hot shower and then it by 10:00 it's kind of gone. OK and with during. So when you wake up sometime between 2:00 and 4:00 is the pain there the whole time until about 10:00. So 910 o'clock 1:50 I'm fine. I am sleeping well. But then if I wake up at 2:00 or 4:00, depending, then it's like the pain is there. It's just it's there nonstop, constant. It's constant. It's coming and going during that. OK. And what about during the daytime? Do you ever have any episodes besides that first thing in the morning? OK. And what about if you're active or physically exerting? Do nothing. Nothing. OK. Any relation with eating? With what? Eating. Yeah, No, nothing. I didn't change anything. I don't eat meat, so that's the only thing. But during the day if you eat there's no pain, no. OK. And any difficulties breathing during the day? No, it's between the the two or four till 7 that's it's hard, it's painful actually. OK I'm short of breath and OK and otherwise no cough or no I don't pull a muscle coughing or lifting anything And how how long when did you first notice this discomfort? Last week, last week, Wednesday, Wednesday, 3rd or 4th of September. Yeah. OK, so it's basically been one week and it's every day. Yep, every night, every day. The same sort of pattern and anything different with your bed or the position? No, the same bed, the same type of bras. The I try I spend Sunday. I thought, OK, I won't wear a bra. Maybe tonight it's going to be fine. No, the same thing. All right. And any bad taste or burning at the back of your throat? I didn't notice that. No. OK. OK. Otherwise any other any other symptoms you've noticed? OK. And how would you describe the discomfort? The the chest thing? Yeah. Well, it's, it's like I'm in the vice. It's like I've got something very tight. Is it? And where it's not here, it's just a bar all around, all the way around and just sort of below your breasts and all the way to the back. Yeah. OK. All right. And otherwise, you said you feel short of breath during that time period, but that's I'm OK. Any leg pain or swelling? No. No. All right. And any previous medical problems? No. No. Specifically diabetes or high blood pressure? No. I checked my diabetes 'cause there was a lot in my family. You've been sick even last night. I was at 6.4. OK. And are you a smoker? No. No. Any family history of heart disease at a young age? My dad? Yeah. Young age? No. Yeah. He was in his 50s when he was 50s. OK, so that sounds. Yeah. All right. And they both passed away with cancer at a young age. So 68 and 72. All right. And otherwise for yourself, any history of blood clots or anything like that? DDTPE, No. And any troubles with your stomach in the past? No. Any cough? Fever. No. OK. Any exercise regiments or anything? No. I used to train a lot more and I stopped just because I'm lazy and I've gained weight, so that's the only thing. All right. And do you work? Yes. What kind of work do you do? I'm a teammate, so I've got teachers. I'm in charge of 15 teachers of the DND. All right. Can I get you? Need just to sit up in here, take a look at you. Do you want the sweater off for it? At least that part off. Yeah. Grab a seat. Good. And any rash, No big breath, just breathe normally. Any pain here and in your abdomen? Any pain here? Anything to your chest itself, any fevers? It's in that spot. Is that right? More in my back during the day. I'm thinking, OK, should I go for a massage or? OK, so you've you've had an ECG which doesn't show anything new. There's a bit of a conduction slowness is there, But that's not something that's usually worrisome, especially it's probably been there for a long time, but I don't see an old ECG to compare to, so it's can't say. But we also checked your cardiac enzyme tests. Those are normal. All your other blood tests are normal. I probably would. You haven't had a chest X-ray here today. I don't think so. We'll probably get a chest X-ray and just to make sure that there's nothing there. My suspicion is that there may be the gastrointestinal with a bit of reflux that's there or bit of a hiatus hernia or something like that just because it's positioning when you're lying flat and it may just take a bit of time after eating suffer things to settle down. But that's, that would, that would be that I think the most likely at this point, it might be if the X-ray is normal. My suggestion would be that we try you on a maybe a two weeks prescription of, of a gastric lowering medicine and see if that slowly gets rid of the problem. It does. And that's, I mean, probably that that's the cause and you might need to stay on it if it comes back after the two weeks, If it's not better after that two weeks, the next step is probably to to have a light down into the the food pipe in the stomach to take a look. OK. But if, if it was your heart, I would expect the enzymes to be positive based on your story. So, and they're completely normal. So I don't think that this and it's not exertional. So I don't think this is your heart. Don't see if it's a blood clot or torn blood vessel in your chest or anything bad like that. But I'll get the chest X-ray just to to be extra sure that there's nothing going on there. Sounds OK good. Thank you very much. So I just wait, so you'll go for the X-ray, OK. And then if that's OK, then basically you get your prescription and and go OK, sounds good. Good."

Yes. Are you OK? Did you need a hand? This is my backpack. Yeah, of course. Myself in here. Yeah. That's OK. I hate these chicks. Yeah, sometimes he's gotta kick it. Yeah, I know they're supposed to be easy, but I've never. That's OK. OK, here's your bag. OK, I'm a bit bit paranoid. That's got my laptop in it, so that's all right. I'm literally no intent about these things. Don't leave that line around here. Oh, sorry. No, I like that the best way. You just don't want to get a small. Yeah. So we have artificial intelligence listening in to us today. I think you guys already chatted about that. What's a little AI between friends? Yeah, that's right. Grab a seat. So while we chat, I actually also want to have a look at your heart. Hopefully I get a better idea what's going on. Is something going on? Well, I don't know that you tell me what's what's the symptoms? Well, I had a bit of pain yesterday for about 10 minutes, which I ignored 'cause I was hosting a party. OK, maybe not the rightest thing. And what time is that? 2:00, 2/15 OK. And what were you doing? Were just chatting. No, I was running downstairs. OK. And no, before I hosted the party. OK. And then this morning, I had it again. I was sitting writing. And I thought, well, that's weird. Yeah. And so I thought, OK, I'd better call the doctor. Yeah, it changed this morning. It just went to a sort of a squeezing, OK. And then that changed after about an hour to sort of discomfort it. It's gone now. It's fine now. OK, So what time this morning again, it was around. Hang on. It was writing and I called the doctor. It was probably around 7:00 AM, OK. And you felt that where? Yeah, right there. And it was kind of squeezing. The pain was pain. Yeah. This squeezing came afterwards. OK. So is this pain? Yeah, it wasn't. I mean, I suffered from trigeminal neuralgia. Yeah, it wasn't that bad. OK, so it was just was it sharp or was it dull somewhere between the two. OK. And that was the same pain that you had yesterday? Yeah. When you were. Yeah, it was very much, very noticeably the same. Yeah. Let me have some. Scan your wristband here so I can ultrasound you while we chat. So of course I looked it up online. Heart attack symptoms in women and one of the things they said is sleep disturbances in the month before waking up in the middle of the night. Well that was fucking under. Are you under statement? Yeah. No. OK, Lie down for me. I am indeed waking up in the middle of the night. So I was up at 3:00 this morning. Yeah. Which, sadly, I wrote. It wasn't a huge issue. Oh, awesome. We have sunglasses. Oh, yeah. You know what? I can actually dim the lights. Thank you. Migraines. My eyes. Yeah. Like, like. So I'm just gonna actually listen. Give me a second deep breath. Deep breath. OK. So this morning, how long did that, like sharp pain? About 10 minutes. OK. And then after, what did it become? It became the squeezing. It's sort of a gentle. Not that gentle. OK Could you, like, undo just this top button there? And then you're going to feel kind of cold jolly. And they put that in my velvet top, aren't you? But just move to the side. Quite like this shirt. OK. Perfect. So that's just like, this is perfect. I like to watch. Yeah. I can show you the screen in a minute. OK. I watch my own colonoscopies. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm weird. Usually people are sedated during this. I stay awake as long as I can. OK, They're very cool. That's actually very tender. But I guess it goes without saying, so no worries. Yeah, sorry. This is just. You've got to get down to it. That might throw me if I grow. I'm not able to OK for now. Where can we put it? And then, yeah, what you can do is actually if you just undo the class for that, yeah, you can still keep that on. But I'm just going to be kind of coming around. Just have to do that. Perfect. And just like that, it's perfect. And so you can keep that. We're actually going to move things up. And then I'm just going to come just from below here. OK. And so any nausea with this? No. OK. Did you feel really sweaty during this episode? No, No. And so after it was like the sharp you were telling me, it kind of moved more into a pressure. Yeah. OK, How long did that last for? About an hour or so. I'm not good at time. And that sort of became a discomfort and then sort of drizzled away. Didn't even notice. It felt. Yeah. OK. And it kind of stayed in the same spot or did it move? Nope. Same spot. Yeah. Sometimes patients describe it going to their arms or their jaw or their back. Any of those. Yeah, not at all. I checked and it was like, everybody else is fine now. Any like, fevers or chills recently? Nope. Hot flashes and menopausal? Sure, sure. No cough. My asthma's fine, 'cause sometimes I've had a little bit of chest pain with my asthma. Really severe. Yeah, and I'm coughing a lot, but my asthma's fine. Yeah. Now, you didn't sound wheezy to me. Yeah, and that's a very different chest pain when you've been coughing. OK, I'll show you just. Oh, good. I like to see this is your heart, so you can kind of see. I'll show you. This is your left ventricle over here. This is your atrium. And then similarly, if I'm going to show you kind of other things we're seeing is some other right side of your heart in and out of you there. And the similarity to a fetus is sadly marked. They're all obscure. CT scan, they're much easier. X-rays. They are. Is it is it pretty in the butt? You guys are good at reading ultrasounds. That's what matters. Yeah. And different info, right? Different tests. Yeah. My friend went upstairs, has a aortic stenosis, pulmonary hypertension and other heart problems. So docs have been bringing Med students in to check his. Whatever. OK, Very cool. Mine's one in the middle, isn't it? Yeah. Sometimes it's good not to be exciting. And actually. Oh fuck yes, he's still alive. He's had it for 30 years. He's quite amazing. He's been written up in journals. Not dead yet so I'm just doing my round of bed and church. Thank you. Come in. Are you OK to come in? So we're almost done. So this is, I mean, you said it's happened to you before with the asthma sometimes, but I mean, your asthma's well controlled, but never anything like this. No, never anything like this. Yeah, that's a very different kind of testing. Yeah. When I've been, you know, coughing so violently. Bronchitis, mostly. I do spectacular bronchitis coughs. OK, That's my specialty. No history of blood clots. No. I mentioned the family, though. No, I wish I made a great piece of pipes, though. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I moved the blood clots due in the family. My mother's got them. Oh, you have? Yeah. And my uncle died of one on the other side of the family too. So that's a good history. Oh, blood clots. Yeah. Oh, OK. He died of pulmonary blood clot. My mother had one, Sir, And my left leg. She didn't die of it, though, which is a shame. She should have done him, but that's life. Yeah, how do you say that? Oh, my mother's found a nice woman. OK, OK, so that's all done. OK, I can pass. Oh, yes, thank you. I'll leave that there. And your belly. There's no pain in your abdomen, right? Well, we're going to do some blood tests. Let's see what comes back. Hey, what's your opinion? That was my ECG. I mean, I'm happy. Yeah, it was fine. The one thing that so there's no like, really what we're looking for is what we call St. elevation. Yeah. So it signs like a heart attack. You did have that. You had these like a little bit of flattening of your T waves, which can happen for a lot of different reasons. No. So I mean, we'll see what your blood work comes back at, OK. I'm also going to put the blood test for kind of a blood clot just to make sure you don't have it, OK? You don't have signs of a big blood clot in your ultrasound, OK. And then we'll go from there. OK. Yeah. Start hanging around for a little bit. And what time did it go away? Totally, that the pain. So, like, does that happen probably when I got seated in here or there was when I noticed it, So maybe sometime between there and here. OK. So maybe like within the last hour. Yeah. Yeah, Yeah. I didn't really know that they just stopped and this is I can't have to just buffer weight. OK. All right. OK, take your time. Thanks. Yeah. And it's causing a little bit of back load. OK, that's normal. That's normal. OK. So that's the bottom line. And then they say that you do also have stones even less. So it's like more at some point. Yeah. So they look around and deliver. It looks OK, everything up high, nothing abnormal. You have an appendix and it's normal. Great. That was the other year when I was on the way here. I was like, it doesn't feel like appendix be like, I don't know what that means. Yeah, that's that's what I was reading. I'm good. Thank you so much for your Oh, my pleasure. I like keeping talking science, so."

Is that tightness something that you've had before? Yes. Does it happen a lot or stay a long time? Yeah. How long was it with you yesterday, Like for an hour or? Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. OK. And do you find that it happens at any particular time? Is it when you're doing something or when you're resting? Yeah. And just the feeling. What does it feel like? Yeah. Does it go somewhere? Does it spread stomach? No, it just stays there. Does it affect you any other way? Does it make you feel and does that happen at the same time as this or is that different? How long has this been happening, this feeling of getting tight? And then you mentioned also blood pressure. Yeah, you're taking medicine for blood high blood pressure. How long have you been taking medicine? When I came to Canada and my drugs, but it does my blood pressure is normal, not give it to me a long time. Then we got so well done, they have to do it. Yeah, and finally give you. So before you came to Canada, we were taking medicine for blood pressure. And you've been on that for a long time. So for a long time it stayed normal. How long have you been in Canada? OK, so the first few months they didn't. They said no, blood pressure's OK, you don't need anything. And then it started going higher. And so now you're taking amlodipine. Yeah. Is that the medicine that you were taking before? Yeah. And did you need other medicines or just amlodipine before? Yeah, just OK. What was 10/10? Yeah. What's here? This is. Yeah. Sometimes it gets too low, right, 'cause you don't want that other people went down too much. Yeah. OK. I mean, today we see your blood pressure is higher, so probably it needs to go back up. That happens sometimes that people take blood pressure medicine and then after some time everything seems back to normal and maybe they don't need medicine for a bit, but slowly keep it for now. We did to make sure that this feeling wasn't from heart injury or something. It didn't, so that's good news. Sorry about the fracture. You know what? One of the other doctors, I don't even see it yet, but I will look at it. She will be in the bed. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You'll be in the bed 'cause some people. I'll look when I get back to the computer. Yeah, just lie down and then let your hand dangle on the side on your back, OK? Yeah, OK. I think. I wonder if I hear maybe a very slight hurt murmur. What did you think was affecting your speech? Did you ever have thyroid problem? You just blood tested for a thyroid condition. We can check that. Sometimes that's something that can make the blood pressure a little higher. Do you, where have you been going for your medications? Oh, yes. And did you see a doctor? Now I have to find them to give me that. I think when they see that the blood pressure has gotten high now that they will understand and they will be also wanting to use some higher dose. Sometimes even amlodipine by itself isn't sufficient. Some people have to take. And the difference is all as well. Yeah. Were you ever on two different types of blood pressure medicine? No. OK. So I will look at blood tests results and the ECG. I will ask them to give you another 5 milligrams. You took already five. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll give you another dose now. So that's going to affect you too. I agree, I do, I do see. OK. So if blood tests are OK, we'll give you the extra 5 milligrams now. We'll give you a note to take back the food to your regular doctor. I think for now I'm gonna check that. Yeah, alright."

Yeah, it was. It's always the right thing to come in and have to get just as fast and see. Yeah, yeah. So it started this morning kind of all of a sudden. Is that really? I wouldn't say. It's like, oh, do I feel something there? And then then it sort of got a little bit worse. A little bit worse. OK Is it still getting worse now? No, no, it's it stopped probably pretty much when I came into the front door. It's kind of subsiding and subsiding and it's pretty much gone. So let's say about two, Like how long, let's say, was it lasting? Yeah, I'd say would it lasted from 8:00 until 9:00, OK. And yeah, at that time got worse and then it sort of got better. Yeah. What helped it get better? Is there anything you did or just naturally don't know? I got in the car, drove here apart. I just in that tire kind of. You didn't take any medication or anything like that. OK. What did the pain feel like? Sometimes people will say it's like a stabbing pain. Sometimes people say sitting like heaviness on the chest. Yeah, not stabbing, I guess. A dull ache. OK. And then?"

He's been having it for about two weeks. OK About. But since his radiation therapy, it got worse, Like, pretty pretty much unbearable. OK. OK. Have you had any fevers with it? No. No. And are you taking any pain medications for the pain? He took his last MTEC yesterday. Final three. Nothing worse. It's called me. OK, That's the Tylenol three. Yeah. And that's not hasn't been helping very much. No. Well, I I bought some just Tylenol off the shelf. OK. And it doesn't doesn't do anything. Are you coughing up anything? Oh, I got coughing yet? You've got lung cancer. Yeah. Yeah. He's always pops. Yeah. Anything different or anything changed recently? Not really. No. She's still popping up. She's got, like, any blood or any.

Yeah. Is it. It doesn't matter where you're lying down and walking away. My on the side or my back. I still have it. I still feel it. So it's just a constant pain. That's there. Is it any association with food? Lots of levities in too late. No. No, because I tried to eat last night for supper and that's not happened. That was true. I was scared to trouble. See, when you went to radiation therapy this morning and the nurse took his vital signs and that's what, like, bring the alarm for her. His heart rate was at, like, 1/21/26. Yeah. Like beating really fast. And his pressure was low. OK. Yeah. And that's why you said he said he had the chest pain. Yeah. So she said. OK. Well, I, I would suggest you go. Would she talk to the oncologist? Yeah. And both of them when we come here, Yeah, go to the ER and your heart is more important than the radiation for now. And you said you've had pericarditis before. Is that correct? Yeah. OK. What? When did you have that? We came in not the Sunday, that just came, the one before on the 18th. On the 18th, we came into the emergency here and that's where they did the scans. And he has a very, very capsy. Yeah. And they had a lung infection or a lung infection too. Yeah. Yeah. And he has a blood clot on his heart and he has his lung cancer, and he got diagnosed with COVID on that Sunday, 02 weeks ago. Yeah. OK. OK. Have you been on antibiotics? No, they couldn't give him antibiotics 'cause he was taking apixabin for his blood clot. OK. So that was interfering with the pericitis treatment. So he's on Apixivan. Is he still on Apixivan? Yeah. Yeah. You're not taking anything else? For the pericarditis? I don't think so. For the aspirin or anything else? I don't think so. OK. And any and no antibiotics for the infection? I don't think so. I'm not sure, uh, 100%. Did they say there was fluid around the heart? Did they say there was any fluid around the there was a inflammation around inflammation.

         "I'm the emergency doctor here this afternoon, so I understand that you're coming in with chest pain. We do have our we have a local research study going on, So I know that we already talked about that with therapies. Persistent. OK. So I was like, looking for your joy. Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry. So she's going to be recording this conversation. Sure. It's just a fault. Patient's coming in with chest pain, right? Patients like yourself. So tell me a little bit more about your chest pain. Yeah, it was when I after I I got up, I ate to go to the washroom this morning and I went back to bed 'cause I don't get up at 8:00. Yeah. And in bed I noticed pain here. I can't call it pain 'cause it was more like uncomfortable, OK. And but it was in here and some tossed and turned and then it went to my back and it went up the back of my neck and then to the shoulder. Your right shoulder, yes. And it wouldn't subside. So at 9:00 I got up. I thought maybe getting up and I made a coffee and I had a Peach for breakfast and sat down and listened to the news. It wasn't going away. Of course, you your head kicks in, right? Your level of concern kicks in. And so I called telehealth around 10:30 and they said they, you know, asked me for all the symptoms and stuff. And they said because of your age, you should go in because it's on subsiding. OK, I start. OK, so, and what did the pain feel like? I want to call it a a dull pain on a bit on the tight side, but nothing, you know, like I've heard people say, oh, it was and was it was it constantly there and it didn't So it didn't go away and you still have the pain right now? No, the in the ambulance they gave me Nitro and it went away 2 minutes later. OK, OK, what time was that? I'd say about 11/20, 11:30. OK, so about 3 1/2 hours. OK, so right now you're don't have any chest pain? None. And any nausea, vomiting, nothing like that. No, just a bit of like headedness, Lightheadedness, that's it. But no fainting episodes or anything bad? No any. Did you feel your part going fast at all? Any palpitations? Nothing like that. And did you feel short of breath with it? No, no, that's what was stopping me from doing anything. It was like I couldn't breathe very well. And so I thought, you know, I'll wait and wait. Wait. And was it ever like a severe pain, like a tearing or no big pain or sharp. Sharp. That was more like a vile, yes. OK. And you said it went towards your arm, your right shoulder and your neck, right? Did it go towards and your back? It didn't go towards your belly or anything like that. Right. And any numbness or weakness in your arms or legs, like not being able to move your arms? No. Like that. Nothing like that. And did you find that the pain got worse with breathing? No. Was it worse with walking? No. No. Any recent swelling in your legs, pain in your legs? Nothing like that. No. And have you ever had a heart attack before? No. But there's a family history, eh? Tell me about that. My father died of his third heart attack at age 46. And they were all severe heart attacks. The first one, I'm 38, and my brother, I'm the second oldest of five siblings. And my younger brother, my young brothers already had two heart attacks. How old was he? He had his first one, 30s. Oh, wow. It was quite early. Yeah. And then my sisters had two strokes, mini strokes. But you never had one yourself. But they do have risk factors like diabetes, yes. Pressure, yes. Are you a smoker or is just smoking at all? No. OK. All right. So right now it sounds like your chest pain free. You're feeling OK right now. Yes. OK. OK. And aside from that, any other medical conditions? Diabetes. Fantastic. OK. And medications. Yes, I take medications. OK. I take mostly for diabetes 1 high blood pressure pill at a very low dosage. Now that I'm retired, there's no concern of my high blood pressure, and I took an antidepressant every day. Yeah. And I have your list from when you came in, right? Yeah, right. All right. And how is the blood work? So let me examine you and then we'll talk about that. OK. You're the boss, 'cause I think we'll probably have to do some weekly testing. Can I just ask you one more thing before this, did you ever have chest pain before? Never. First time. You never had chest pain or trouble breathing, walking or anything like that? No, with the in and out of your mouth. Can I get you to sit up for a second just to listen to the back here? Same thing with the breathing. You can lie down and no trauma or injury or anything like that. Any trauma or injury to the chest, We're just going to check your belly and take a look at your legs, OK? OK. Do you want to bring this down? Just a bit, actually. So my hands are cold. No. No. OK. Is that good enough? Yeah. What surgery is this from? This is the gallbladder and then hysterectomy. All the best. All right. Yeah. Yeah. No swelling? No. OK. And you haven't had any recent travel or surgery or anything like that, nothing more like 3 days? Well, I've had cataract surgery 2 weeks ago. OK, that's not surgery, that's but no like major surgery, nothing. No. OK, OK, all right. Sounds good. So in terms of next steps, so in your initial blood work, one of the tests that we look at is your heart enzyme. Just call this phone in. It's a little bit elevated. OK, Now the tracing to your heart it otherwise I don't see an acute heart attack on a tracing of your heart right now. But sometimes we find heart attacks in the we see signs of that in the blood work. OK, So what that means is that we have to repeat the blood work. So if it's pretty similar compared to your first Test, then it's unlikely for it to be a heart attack. It was just a little bit elevated. If it's rising, then that makes me more concerned about a heart attack that we're not seeing on the tracing heart. Then given that you do have a strong family history, however, and just with family history and your risk factors, if those heart testing is looking OK, I'll be OK for you to go home. But following up with cardiology is an outpatient if we have a rapid chest pain clinic. So I'll put a referral in there, but it comes back as more elevated than you know. We'll have to have another discussion. Now that repeat test is going to be around 3:30. My shift actually finishes at 4:00 PM. So what will happen is I'll let Doctor Norman is the one doctor taking over for me. OK, So I'll let him go to follow up on your blood work. OK? Does that sound OK to you? That sounds good. And of course, like, you know, for when you go home, right? Like if, if you do go home, right, if the chest pain comes back, it's a lot more worse, right? You're having trouble breathing and you got to come back. OK, To the emergency department, OK Umm, And I'll just add on a chest X-ray as well, just to make sure it does. OK OK, Thank you very much. And that was very clear. Thank you. You're welcome. Open those. Do you want this up or down?"

Yesterday evening around 8 I'd say when they've been constant. I didn't have a very good night's sleep. Yeah. And then this morning, I feel like headed and then I watch telling me I have low heart rate. So I with all those symptoms, that's about maybe I should get checked out. And absolutely. Absolutely. What were you doing when you had the pain? Nothing. I was watching TV, resting Was were you watching something like, you know, frightening or No, No, no. Just good news. Not no bad news. OK. Good. Good. So how would you describe your pain? How did it feel like to you? It's like a pinch, A little pinch. Yeah. So it's it's not pressure. So no, it's like a squeeze. A squeeze. Yeah. Does it move anywhere? No. When you take a deep breath, does it feel like it's like somebody's stabbing you with with needles or a knife? No. Does it go to your back? No. I had some pain on the right side, but not for long. But usually it stays there. It doesn't move very much. OK. And it's it's constant since last night. Yeah. Were you were you sweaty when this happened? Like, no, you didn't feel you're sweaty. You didn't feel you want to this morning. I was feeling like headed and. But last night was just a chest pain. Have you had any heart attacks before? No. Do you smoke? So no, we don't. Excellent. Excellent. You have a family history of young people having heart attacks? No. You have no diabetes? Nope. No high blood pressure? Nope. No high cholesterol? No. The only thing you have is I I see in your file that you have you had a clot in your leg and PE as well. So I had both. So I'm, when was your PE? I think it's 2010. It's been a long, it's been a long time. Oh yeah. What's where does the does, does did this pain feel the same like your PE or different? No, no. So you're, you're a lifelong. Well, the PE mostly was a shortness of breath. So every time I was doing a little exercise, I was like pumping hair. And then I, that's when I, I went to urgent care and then they sent me to the hospital. I said OK, we checked out. Did they did they figure out why you had the clot? Is it because, you know? Oh, they ran the OK battery of tests and they. So they called it unprovoked. Basically. Yeah. Yeah. Because provoked sometimes if you have a surgery or No. Yeah. OK. Fair enough. OK, enough. No problem. Did you faint since yesterday? Nope. No. OK. You felt your heart is beating low today. Well, I don't know. It's my watch keep. Usually it's in the morning like it's going to say it's below 45 BPM for more than 10 minutes and it's keep giving me warnings but it's only in the morning for some reason. During the day it's mostly OK and at night same thing. So I have when I wake up, I have a bunch of warnings and low heart rate. So which sounds good, right? Your your your first workout like your ECG and your heart enzyme are normal, which is good. So you don't have a heart attack. I don't think it's a heart attack. It's maybe something else does it hurts when I if I press on your chest. You did not do any physical? No, No. OK, all right, no fever, no cough fever. I don't think so. It took you didn't feel your heart in the last few days. No. All right, Sounds good. You're not coughing. I'm not coughing, but I had the light headed in the past too like with the warning, but the low heart rate and the in the morning soon in the morning that I I feel that open in your stomach. No swelling in your legs. Nope. Where was the DTT right or left? Left. Yeah. They look the same size. They don't look OK. I usually I go once once a year for follow up exam covering you the prescription and everything. So look, there's always the risk that since you had a clot before that you couldn't can develop another one even though you're on the blood thinner. Some, some people, it's usually it's good for most people, but some people might still develop a clot even though they have they are on a blood thinner. Since I don't think this is your heart, I think we have to make sure that this is not a new clot in your lung. OK, sounds good. Sure. All right, I'll send you for an X-ray maybe and have to CT scan as well. OK, you're you're at least moderate risk. So let me start with a blood test, an X-ray and we'll see after that. OK. OK. All right. Sounds good. Good. Good to see you soon."

So so I I've got some pain right here just in a little rib cage. It's been going on for about two to three weeks now. It seems to be getting worse and it's constant pain. And every now and then I'm getting that a, a jolt almost. So it just lasts a second. But it's just. Yeah. So I went to to see my doctor. And what ended up happening, I got back, back. So my, my, my son, sometimes he just lifts me and we crack the back. That's it. Now, this time here, I didn't think we were cracking. I just went in for a hug. He grabbed me and he lifted me. So I yelled out and I ended up breaking some ribs on this side. Oh, did you really? Yeah. Oh, the, the and the pain here on this side here now the the ribs I've broken in the past, broken ribs in the past. So I know how that is. This is completely different. And the doctor, when I waited to see him, my my family doctor, he gave me some, some anti inflammatories. Yeah. And I took those two days later, I went back to their walk in clinic. It was worse. So then they, they realized, OK, maybe it's the stomach. So they had given me some anti inflammatories that sometimes make stomach issues worse. So, so now, so I ended up going for an, an abdominal ultrasound. OK, they didn't see anything, but there's still something. And now I, after they, they called me about the ultrasound saying that it's there was nothing. I'm like, OK, what's the next step? OK, and they renewed my Tylenol three prescription. OK, that's where we're at right now. So I don't know where it is. It's getting worse, but it feels like it's it's not going away. No, it's not going away. And that's it now."

And then I was very worried last night because I was thinking about it yeah, that maybe something has happened to me. Why am I not breathing properly anymore? So I tried to sleep, but when I tried to to breathe and I I it's not the way I do. Yeah, then maybe I'm holding too much, but I was concerned. Then I said I should come and so that we can take a look. Maybe something is wrong and you know, so be I've been using some chemicals in the house, try to, to do some cleaning in the bathroom. OK. I don't know, just like household cleaners, you mean or just for regular cleaning the bathroom for myself. And then someone one day told me that using those also being to expose too much for to those can cause some breathing issue. I don't know if it's through. OK, let me ask you maybe a few things. Can you tell me like what kind of chemicals just regular product. The one we buy in in pharmacy, the names, I think it's we have all these. OK. And there's another one. Vine or vein. Oh, OK. Those kind of things, You know, we spray on the wall and the bathroom, then we wash. OK. Of course, with the mask and and gloves. Oh, OK. You're ringing. But I don't. If somehow I can. I don't know. Can I ask you a few other questions? Have you ever had chest pain like this before? Yeah, yes. OK. When was that or can you tell me? I don't remember, but I know it's not long ago. OK. And I think that's when again, I went to the hospital, OK. Because I was at the hospital again not long. Was that in June? I saw you were here in June. Yes, in June. I was taken to of the, I think Civic yeah. And I was reading that they found the blood pressure was high, but they thought you were having a viral infection. Exactly. Those those are the results. They also did all kind of heart and nothing was fun with my were you having anything? Were you having pain then, though you were having chest pain or it was there was some pain on the in the chest, but it wasn't really, but it was just the that day. It was, that was the first time I was, I was also having fever and that's why I came. And then they found that I was, uh, there was a virus here. OK. And, uh, you mentioned that the pain started on Saturday. Yes. So Saturday evening, Saturday. Is it just been constantly there since Saturday? Yes, like it's been there all day or since Saturday evening all night, Sunday, all day and all night yes and then until today. But I can still move around and do things. Maybe because I'm thinking about it all the time. OK, fair enough, but it is there. I I went out, I did shopping and do things, but when it's time to sleep, then I I worry much. I just want to ask you one or two questions because that's how I'll be able to figure out what this is. You mentioned that, like, you've been going about your business, you've been sort of moving around, doing stuff. When when you do that, does the pain get worse? So if you're exerting yourself in any way or working or walking, does the pain get worse? No, it's remained the same way. Yeah. And you said the pain is like a pressure. Not really. Oh, OK. What's it? It's just when I'm about to go to bed and just when I start trying to sleep. Yeah. Then I can feel that I'm not, you know, when I try to breathe, I feel like short of breath. Yeah. It's not going deeper. It's very short. OK. But in terms of the actual discomfort that you're feeling in the chest, is that a sharp pain, a dull pain, a burning, a pressure? Like, what would you say? It feels like It's a minor burning, a burning kind. Very minor. Does it get worse if you take a big breath in? No. No, it doesn't change at all. No. OK. Have you been coughing? Yes. Slightly. Like a little bit. Yeah. Anything coming out? No, no, Just some dry coffee. Dry coffee? Yeah. And something like that. OK. It's also uncomfortable, of course. Because. I don't know why?

And I see my doctor also. Yeah, very often. So we have never. Yeah. You know, you mentioned that these symptoms are especially bad when you're lying down. Yeah. Do you wake up at night with trouble breathing? Like sort of able to fall asleep but all of a sudden you wake up? The problem is that I'm I'm not sleeping at all because of thinking about it. Then I will go to the bathroom, and that's OK. Maybe I should just go from there, try to sleep again. No, I sleep either. It's like, yeah, you're sort of thinking about it and pain. I don't know. Which is very normal, right? Very normal. Yeah. But you haven't been using more pillows? Like you haven't been? Sort of. No. Just you're able to lie flat? No. Just the same pillow, the same level.

No. No, I haven't traveled in the past last month. No. No broken bones or surgery. No, nothing. Nothing like that. OK. And in terms of the cough, you said you're not coughing anything up, not coughing up any blood, just a smart coughing. And it's dry, but it's not permanent. Yeah. Yeah. I was reading something in the triage note about noisy breathing. Like, I don't know if they understood that correctly or, you know, it's noisy breathing. And that's what is, is making me more comfortable. Sometimes even someone sitting beside me can hear that there is a voice coming from my chest. So why am I hearing this voice? You know, it's real. This is the first time. Yeah. Then I said maybe there's something that is obstructing something. Uh huh. OK. Why in. Yeah. No, I I hear you. Yeah. And that the problem actually, that's that's one of the the thing that's that was sending me. Yes. You've never had asthma. Like when you were little, you didn't have problems with the lungs or anything. No. No. OK, OK. I just want to take a look at a few different things. Are you able to come and have a seat here? Are you on any medications like So what do you take for the high blood pressure? You're just on one medication or I think they they could add, add low something. OK, add more. I don't know the name. OK, I'll try to see in the computer. But you just take one medication. Just one. No allergies to any medications. No. OK. OK. So I'm just going to take a look at a few different things. OK. Can I just see your wrist here? Yeah. OK. And I'm just going to have a listen to your back here. OK. No need to move this shit. Sure, thank you. Just going to have a listen here to get back, take some big breaths in and out. I'm just going to have a listen here. OK. And then are you able just to lie back? Sure. Push a little bit on your belly. That doesn't hurt at all. No. And you said no fever or chills or anything. OK. Yeah. I'm just going to take a look at your ankles. OK, Sure. I'm just looking for swelling and a few. No problem. So I don't see any swelling there. No pain here if I do that? No, no. OK. I'm just going to do the same thing on the other side. Sure. OK. That's OK, too. No program. OK, I'm here. You could sit up. OK. Yeah. So you know, what I would suggest is we did some blood work. I'm just going to add on another blood test, OK, To the blood work that we have, Yes. And I'd also like to do a chest X-ray because that just allows us to get a bit of a better picture of the lungs. Yeah. OK. What we sort of want to make sure is that there's nothing dangerous going on with the heart, OK, or any other dangerous cause. But from the way you're describing it, it sounds pretty reassuring. Like it doesn't really sound like a heart attack or anything bad or dangerous. That's what I was asking. And we were talking about how do we define? How do I know? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's like a very reasonable reason to come to the emergency department. So I said maybe, but the question doesn't show. Maybe there's a yes or no. Yeah. Well, I said maybe. So we use a few different things. We sort of hear your description of it and examine you and then use some tests and then all that together sort of helps us a little bit. Do you find you have any problems with like spicy food and like no pain ever in the stomach or anything like that I eat well and no problem yeah spicy or non spicy no problem with food nothing totally yeah okay So what I would say is if you head to the X-ray department okay so if you follow the signs on the wall for."

I understand that. Yeah. OK. But did the pain go anywhere, like into your nap, down your arms? No. No. Just in the middle. And can I ask you, what type of work do you do? Are you working presently? I'm a nurse. Yeah, a nurse. OK. Do you do a lot of lifting? Some no, but few one month ago I I did like AI built at my place at shell, you know yeah. Oh, you moved some stuff yes and that was about a month ago Yeah, but you didn't feel any pain at that time No, I was feeling the pain, but but it was it a little worse after you did the boot lifting? No Depends even if yeah Oh no, I know it's still there. But but did it get worse after you did the lifting I mean I mean when I was I was lifting the stuff the pen was still there. You still there? So you had it more than a month. OK, You know it is two different pen 02 different before it was like a normal pen. It came and then so go away in a second. But this one is stained. I take a deep breath. It's stained. Yeah. OK. Not a problem. And how is your health? Normally speaking? Are you a healthy guy? Yes. Do you take any medication? On a regular basis? No. Of the allergies to anything. Oh, I Now when you just go for a walk or you climb some stairs, does this pain occur? So just when you breathe? I can I can run. Not a problem. And do you smoke at all? No, not at all. If you're a healthy guy. OK. Any abdominal pain? No, none at all. OK. Do you think I could get you to sit up there? And I just want to have a quick look at you. OK? Yeah. Just take your jacket off there, OK. Just sit on the side. Facing this way. This side? Yeah, just facing this way. No, no, Sit, sit. OK. And that's good. Now I just want to see if anything triggers the pain. Can you bring your hang on? Can you bring your head back? I just want to see if moving the neck makes it any worse. No pain? No. OK. And there's no pain up here, OK. And none of the shoulders. And if you reach up above your head, do you feel it in here? No. And if you reach across your body, do you feel it in there? And if you reach behind your back, do you feel it in there? OK, good. Now I just want you to relax. I'm going to do a little light pushing. Is that sore at all? No. No pain at all whatsoever. OK. And not pain on the side here either. Kind of lie you down, put your head, bare feet up here. OK, I'm going to push lightly in your tummy. You tell me if it hurts suddenly pushing. There's no pain. No pain at all. OK. Sit up again. And then you pain along the center of your back? No. Have you had any skin rashes anywhere in the last week or so? Any rashes on the skin? Yeah. Yeah. Where was the rash? Like here? Oh, on the leg. But I meant to like the in the chest area. You do? When you looked in the mirror, you didn't see anything that's going to pull your shirt up. I just want to see if there's any rashes there. OK, Not maybe seeing anything there. Let's have a look up here. And not seeing anything there, OK, You'll put that down. OK. And any pains in your lower legs, like in the calf muscles? Nothing at all. OK. If you take a deep breath now, do you feel it? OK, Right now I don't feel it. You don't feel it. OK, Not a problem. So they took some blood work on you. So far everything's come back. OK, I don't have all the blood work, but it's so far it's coming. I looked at your ECG, it's 100% fine. This is not a heart pain. OK? I can tell you for sure it's not for your heart. It's not your heart. It could be from the lung or it could be the muscles when they sort of come to the chest wall. So what I'd like to do is send you for a chest X-ray just to make sure there's nothing going on in the lung that's causing the pain. Yes, if it looks normal and the rest of your blood work comes back fine, I don't think you need to worry about it. If you could probably take if you're not allergic to it or have stomach problems, some Aleve if the medication helps inflammation, maybe take that for a week and see if it doesn't clear it up. OK, I have a feeling it could have been from trigger, maybe you had a little bit of different pain then, but it could have been more constant when you after you did the lifting and all the movements of the stuff a month ago. That could be why. So you might have got like an intercostal muscle strain. OK, But I don't think it's anything too worrisome based on the history of the exam so far. OK, So if you want to grab your stuff, I'm going to send you for a chest X-ray after you've had the X-ray."

         "Hi, Doctor Lee, Emergency department. Cause your heart's really slow. Are you having some chest pain? Yeah. I'm sorry. Are we good? Quite dizzy and weak. Yeah. And when did you start feeling dizzy and weak? Last night, Eh, 1:30 in the morning. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. OK. Right. OK. And the, the chest, you said you're lightheaded, and that started today, right? Yeah. And that was that also when the chest pain started. Yeah. OK, and when was your last dialysis? Yesterday. Yesterday. OK, so you had dialysis yesterday and I go there tomorrow and you go again tomorrow. I see. OK. Wednesday. Friday. Yeah. It's now your heart is going very slowly. Is that normal for you? No. No, it's totally not normal. Eh. Well, it's scary. OK, I'm going to take a quick look at your heart with the ultrasound. OK. Have you had any nausea or vomiting? I really like. OK. You feel a bit nauseous. Have you had any diarrhea? No, no diarrhea. OK. And does the pain is where is the pain? Right here. It's right there on the left side of your chest, eh? And yeah, it's a heaviness. Or it's a heaviness, eh? It's sharp. Does it go all the way through to your back? No. No. OK. Does it go anywhere else? No. No. All right, just going to take a look at your heart with the ultrasound here. OK. Is this kind of the area that you have pain? Yeah. Yeah. Right. And so the. And the what time do you think this morning did the Lightheadedness start? 730 around 7:30? Is that when you woke up? Yeah. OK. That's when you woke up, eh? Yeah. And have you ever had Lightheadedness like this before? No. No. OK. And have you had chest pain like this before? No. We like to go over these guys. What's that? Because I know you had some pain with dialysis the other day, right? Heart was low. Yeah. And they thought it was because your heart was low. That was yesterday, right? And then you were seeing here. And then the heart doctor saw you and said it might be your vesophilal, your blood sugar, your medication, right. Yeah. OK. And then they said. And when you saw them yesterday, were you feeling crummy? Were you feeling lightheaded? And not that much now you're feeling a lot worse. Hey. I see. OK. That's why you came back. I understand. OK. Yeah. OK. All right. I think that's fair. So I'm going to just, sorry, take another look here at the. Now, I might give you some medication in a little bit to see if we can speed up your heart rate a little bit to see if that makes you feel better. OK. Because I think that'll be it'll be important. Sometimes we need to put special pads on you and use that to make your heartbeat, OK. So it's certainly that can be something that happens as well. But I think it makes sense to start with some medications, OK. And I think what we should probably do is move you to another part of the department with where we can monitor you a little bit closer. OK. Do you have any questions for me right now? Problem. Well, it's a good question. It sounds like your heart's not beating properly, and so we need to sort that part out. What's that? Well, no, we wouldn't expect something like that to 'cause this. Yeah, you know, But certainly, I think your heart's just not happy right now, and we need to fix that. OK, well, what's that? Stay here or not? Well, we're we're you stay here. We'll probably move you to another part of the department. OK. Room nowhere. Well, you're going to stay in the other room until the cardiologist sees you and then go from there. OK. OK. Give me a second. Thank you. No problem. OK. All right. Yeah. Don't worry. We'll take all your stuff with you. OK. OK. So you. Doctor Lam. I'm Doctor Lam. That's right. OK. All right. Well, pleasure to meet you. The cardiology team will come see you soon. OK, all right. Getting over there. No, you stay here. You just stay here, OK? We'll take care of you. OK? OK. No problem. And are you still having the chest pain now? Yes. Yeah. OK. Oh my God are they cool. You smoke with the dog."

Dark eyes. And then you can't totally dark eyes. Why not? Because my eyes are blue, not dark. That wasn't too funny. OK, What brings you in here today We left Rice Hill a visit one off but I was having my brother for the week and we left Rice Hill to go to a funeral in our here. So Diane was with me at the other place and then the ambulance to the ambulance. So she managed to get a rather taking her ear. OK, so she didn't find her way. They told you that. And so you started to feel symptoms in my stomach in the car. Oh, I had, I've been over and it and the pain was so strong. I cannot, I, I've never been, I never had such a heart pain. And then after they gave me the four aspirins, the pain started to OK, at first it the pain stopped here and it went up, but not to my throat, OK, just throughout here. And then all of a sudden it's OK. Do you remember the exact time that started? Exact time. I would say 10-40, maybe 1040. I know when the pain started. Yeah. 10/10/10 Is that add 15 minutes roughly because we were halfway from his house to captain and in second-half. And what did that pain feel like? It felt like, I'm not sure what to explain. It's so painful. It was not like a stab. It was not like maybe a punch, OK, maybe started here right, right at the and went up. And then after I had four restaurants, it went up OK. Did it kind of come across? No. It's just just like it's and it's down into the arms over. No. Or down into the legs? No. Did you ever feel like someone was like sitting on your chest? No, it was like maybe a pressure, but not. Was that after you had the aspirin, you started to feel a pressure? No, No, before when it first started, I didn't know what to do and I didn't want to go to the clinic because that's me. Well, were you waiting at the time it happened? I was sitting. Richard is driving Diane like his wife, my sister-in-law. And then I have a brother here and brother at the back. Oh, so you're sitting in the back seat. Well, not the back back seat because it's a van. So, but right after, after the two front. So I'm sitting there and Richard did to mention to move one seat that we're giving. I said no, I prefer about seeking him. And I said the boys, they can do. How long have you been in the car at that time? At that time the game started. Yeah, 15 minutes, About 15 minutes. Any like activity, like, were you going up a flight of stairs or like rushing to get to the car? No, because it's a house and the car is right almost through the door and Richard was driving. It was the pain. Did you feel like, sick to your stomach at all? No, no. I'm feeling really flush in the head, sweaty. But I think here they noticed that my skin was damp or something. Damp a bit kind of clanny. Well, I didn't notice. OK. But that's what they they they'd say, yeah, I'll read the note sometimes. Yes. OK, we're feeling like you couldn't catch your breath at all. Not a problem at all. I had no breath problem at all. And no headaches and just that. Yeah. Has anything like this ever happened to you or not that I can remember. I barely ever any like sick the eventful conditions, you know, forcing for no, the only thing I had in my whole life be found by two, I think it's called and it was removed for pocket. Oh, OK. Where where was that? Oh, under the arm. OK. And I said it's the same thing that happened to the other arm. Not lightly, but it did. It did. So they're both done. OK. Yeah. And that's OK. That's OK. And you. It was the sweat gland. Oh, gosh. Yeah. OK. All right. Yeah. A little bit of the cysts that point, something like that. Yeah. And in a way. And you pumped your heart before ever had to do testing, like someone put you on a treadmill or did like an ultrasound of your heart, things like that. I did had ultrasound when I was going and I was asked to have this done before I broke out of town forever. Oh, has anyone told you you've had like an an abnormal rhythm of your heart or anything like that? And I had my gallbladder, but my mom did too. And how are you feeling right now? Good. Any pain Is that any of that come back? No, not at all. Able to still take deep breaths. Yes. Getting up until today you've been well or you've been feeling sick. Like how? Like a virus? No, I had breakfast. My usual dose something so yeah, just so it sounds like it's just really out of nowhere. You had this pain and then it didn't get better until again, you uh, until I had check this here. Sometimes we monitor apps a little funny for it. Yeah, that's just your. That's how we read your. Yeah. And so around 1040 years. So sorry to have this. Almost like someone punched me in the gut and like that kind of sensation in your stomach, like right above here. Yeah. You know where the rib goes like this was that. Yeah. There. OK All right. And then it. It was getting worse and worse. How would you rate it on the on the scale on the 10? I told the lady probably, I don't want to say 10, but I think I am. Yeah. To attend. How? Well, it's pretty serious. It was very. Yeah, very, very three. And after strong serious and after Oscar felt better and it got better after the Asper. How long? After the not very long, like like second. I won't listen to your heart, your lungs. I'm going to also just check your pulses, things like that. Looking around the legs for any signs of swelling. Soon to grab the ultrasound machine because I want to look at the ultrasound machine and look at the heart itself as well. And I can go up there. Oh, it should be fine there. No worries at all. Thank you. Just like that, just three flow and stuff. Deep breath in. Yeah, OK, let's do it. OK, deep breath in again. OK, deep breath in your heart and your lungs sound OK. So just feeling your closest in the distance. Sometimes it has a blood vessels in the heart. Just going to check for swelling in your legs. I I think I could just say I had my gallbladder removed. You did mention you had your gallbladder removed and like 2 underarms. I told you that too. OK, yeah, I was reading in your chart there was something with your heart before. They said you had like a right branch block. Does that name sound familiar? A right bundle branch block? Have you heard of that term before? No, I'll double check the chart. But I saw there was some previous stuff from heart doctors in the past that they're looking at how your heart rhythm was. What do you mean that was done here in the hospital? It looked like it was. I'll, I'll, I'll get the dates and stuff and kind of verify that with you because it has, may help me to remember. Yeah, Yeah. Just to kind of remind you and I'll. I'll get an idea of that as well, too. Yeah. Really. The thing is, and whenever people have pain in their chest and here as well too, we always wonder and worry about the heart. Well, that's what Richard told me. That's why he was. Yeah, checking me because he was a technician, lab technician, the lab tech. OK, in Toronto. OK, Got you. For many years. OK. I yeah, there's a couple of things we do. One of them is we do an ECG, which is tracing the heart and looking at the rhythm there. And we do blood tests where we look for a specific heart enzyme and if it's elevated, it shows that the heart's under strain where it's not getting enough blood supply to it, OK. The ECG also shows us signs of that as well, too. Umm, and we look to see if there's any changes with that. So we look at a one that's been done before. There's been a couple on your chart for UPS series as well too. And then we see if there's any changes going forward. At this time, there are a bit of changes on the decision to show that there is a bit of screen happening on my version. OK, I'd like to repeat the ECG, but if they haven't already done so to see if that's getting worse and worse, which kind of leads us towards more of like we're worried about it either there's not enough. What's by happening to your heart? The the heart enzyme blood test also gives us some information on that as well too. OK, the the fact that your pain has gone away right now is a reassuring, but we are going to be keeping the cool side. OK, I want to bring the ultrasound in look at the heart itself, see how it functions as well too. That just gives us a bit more information with all of that put together, I'm going to talk with my supervisor about about you what we talked with me about you and the next best sensitive OK is the question. And the thing we don't want to miss is when you're having the fact that things have improved is reassuring. But we are keeping it close side because there has been some evidence that your heart has had some strain to it, which again is related to the blood supply. And it's just while things are stable right now, we want to keep the place. Do you have any questions about that right now? No, I just, I can carry on with my life. I can. I can still walk. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's it. Right now, too. Today, Right now, your job is to to lie your rest. Yeah. Wait for the blood test to come back. But most importantly, if you start to feel that that pain is coming back, you're sharing the field clan under your front and you feel like you can't catch your breath, ring the bell and you let the nurse and I'll come get me a lawsuit. OK. I'm going to grab the option machine. Thank you. No worries."

We did the rhythm strip of your heart, which looks good, so everything looks normal on that Before. Did some blood work to to look at how your heart's working. If it's under any stress, if you're fighting an infection, I think maybe I'll order a chest X-ray as well because you've been having this really deceptive cloth to make sure that that's not the source of this chest pain. Two, because sometimes it can come from our lungs as well. OK, But no fevers? No. We'll do a COVID as well because that's often contribute to it as well. OK. Any questions at all?

         "Yeah, yeah, Thank you so much. I was pretty run drunk and I passed away on Monday last night. Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you. And I really just I lost my voice for a day or two. So I was just young and with the cough, it it was a strong cough and it was like shit coming out of my chest. Like it looks pussy to me, like it doesn't look good. And I was laying down. It was like not even 3:00. I had just dozed off. Everything. I've never had no pain in my chest at all, not even my whole life, nothing like that. And then I just felt like I got stabbed in the chest of having just like that. And the dreamy shoot up out of my bed, like gas for air. What's going on? And it hasn't. It hasn't gone away. And it's. So it's still there now. Oh, yeah, Yeah. And it's. And is it on the right side? Only there? Yeah. It's all across in here. OK. Yeah. And does it radiate anywhere? Does it go into your back, into your belly, any down your arm and your jaw? It just stays right there on the right side. Yeah, but yeah. How do you describe the pain? Is it like a shooting pain? It's like a knife. It's a knife like a stabbing thing. And it's not, it's not going like, it's not going like weak and strong. It's constant. Yep. It's just one big. Yeah. I feel like there's a knife in there. I take a breath and no, I can't go past there because it's then it's really shooting pain. OK, So it's worse when you take a big, deep breath in. OK. Do you feel short of breath? Was it? Yeah, yeah. Like I can't breathe. Nausea or vomiting with it. Yeah, I felt really nausea this morning and I was going to throw up, but I'm, I'm that type of person where unless I'm really going to throw up. Yeah, yeah, kind of hold it down. Yeah. OK. I went and got something to eat, but OK, didn't help that much. OK Dizziness with it at all? No, no dizziness. Right. And you're just lying in your bed when it happened. You weren't doing any anything like that? No. And you've never had a history of chest pain before? No. No. OK. And are you still? Is the cough getting any better or worse over the last week or about? No, it's the same. It's the same. Yeah. I just thought I had a cold. Like a chest cold. Yeah, from crying too. I had a lot of sinus and build up. So ever caught up any blood? No, no. And have you noticed any leg pain or swelling at all? Nothing in your legs at all? No. And you haven't, like you haven't traveled anywhere. You haven't had any long car rides or drives or anything like that recently? No. No history of blood clots at all? No. No. Do you smoke at all? I do, yeah. I don't smoke about half a pack a day now. But I mean, it can get worse too. Like more than half a pack. I mean, my friend are, like, talking right now because he's got lung cancer, smoking, and he just said we got to quit. Yeah. You know, and you got to quit. Yeah. My aunt died of COPD, emphysema, like, severe. So, you know, it's time. But this is not from smoking because first of all, I don't smoke in the house. And when it's not late at night, I might have half a cigarette or something every, like, hour or two. Not even. You've been doing that for a while and you've never had that type of pain. Yeah. I was all filled up in bed. Man, it was so comfortable. And then I just couldn't lay back down. Any other drug use at all? No, no Ivy drug use at all. No, no. OK. I need fevers with the cough. I feel like I'm getting a fever now 'cause I keep sweating, OK, but then I immediately get the chills. So I don't know if that's part of it, 'cause. But you've never taken your temp at home or anything like that? Oh, no, no, I don't need to. Yeah, I would be able to. I, I have six kids and, you know, you just know when there's a fever and you can tell. And is anybody else sick at home, your kids coughing, anything like that? Thank God. No. OK, so I just have the one girl at home. The rest are growing on their own. And she's she's always pretty healthy. She gets the glands. But like, yeah, I know. I'm just more. I'm just like, what the hell is going on? Yeah. Sore throat, runny nose, anything like that? No, not really. No. OK. No ear pain? No, no, no. And no pain with peeing at all. No, no, no. OK. I need to listen to your heart and your lungs. OK. I'm sure. Did you see? Did you see the X-rays actually looked OK? Nothing on the X-ray? Yeah, that would be. Yeah. So all the tests so far have looked all reassuring. Yeah. Do you ever feel like your heart's racing at all with it? No. No, you don't get that. I that's what I was wondering, too. I was like, I'm very calm. Yeah, I'm not. There's nothing going on except feeling. Yeah, it's over here. Were you feeling anxious when you woke up at all with it? No. No. Well, yeah. Well, yeah, because I was scared, Yeah. And I jumped in the shower and tried to do something calm, but I just wasn't going away at all. Have you taken anything for the pain yet? Like, did you try taking Advil, Tylenol? I didn't have any at home. I didn't take anything yet. And did you, have you been doing any like, big arm workouts or anything like that? Chest press and nothing like that? That would be no right in that spot. All right, let me. So weird you're back. Are you on the birth controls? A little? No. Or IUD. Or are you on any hormones at all? I don't take anything. Your heart right here and any pain in your belly? No, nothing there. Very isolated in that. Right in there. I'm going to feel on your chest wall and you tell me that, like when I'm pushing, if it can bring about the pain or if you feel it at all. There's a muscle now. That's a muscle. I don't know. It went through somewhere, but I don't know what that is. Is that tender when I'm touching there, though? Yeah. Yeah, it's not. Yeah. A little there, more in here. Not really. Yeah, right in there. Yeah. Like one spot I'm pushing. That really does it right. Yeah. And it goes right into it here. I'm going to look at your scan. OK. Yeah. I just want to see where I'm pushing. It's not red or anything. At least it's right in there. Yeah. There's 11 spar specifically. I am. OK. All right. I'm just going to feel your belly. I'll get you to lie down for me, too. OK. Your lungs sound good. I hear all the air from the top to the bottom of it. Feels good. I don't feel bad. I don't. There's nothing that happened. I just and I are you still feeling short of breath? Yeah, Yeah. I can only get it to here. Yeah. OK. And and no history of clock before at all. No, no, no, no. Not for me or any of my kids. Yeah. I shake. My mom made. I had one, but she was really sick and yeah, this year. So. Yeah. OK. OK. I'm gonna is the third all right here? No, no. OK. I mean, just because I ate or I'm tiny. So it's. Yeah. Now it's nothing to do. OK, Yeah, go ahead, sit up. OK. And right now, how bad is the pain still on that right side? So I said eight a while ago. I could say 7 right now because it's just. Yeah, just. I don't know. And when you take a big, deep breath in, does it make up the pain worse? Or do you just feel like you can't cut your breath with it? No, I can't. I can't Debrief. OK. OK, I'm going to review some of the other tests that we ordered for you. So far, what we've ordered all looks good. So we look at something like your ECG, which is the rhythm of your heart looked fine, which is good. We looked at another blood marker that we can test to look at kind of the muscle stress of your heart. Hold your troponin that was fine, too low. And then the chest X-ray also looks good. Looks clear that there's nothing that could be like causing it, like a pneumonia or something like that. I don't think I have pneumonia, no. It would show us on the chest X-ray. The only thing is you do have a bit of an elevated White County, which usually can suggest sometimes that you're fighting an infection of sorts. OK. I just don't have a source of that infection because your lungs look good. If you're not having belly pain, you're not having anything else. So I don't have like, diarrhea, nothing else. Yeah. Yeah. So it's possible it's more like a virus too. So it's possible if you have a viral infection you got have you tested for COVID at all? Have I what tested for COVID? No, no, no, I don't like touching my nose. I just don't I haven't tested. I haven't really done anything with COVID. I kind of stay away from OK, I may order just a swab to see if that's what it is. It doesn't go up to here and then kind of go from there without the weight count and you're you can have a weight count for a variety of reasons as well, but everything we've done so far looks all reassuring that it's not. I have a low suspicion that it's cardiac. Like it's your heart specifically. Your lungs look OK on the X-ray from like a pneumonia perspective. You don't have many risk factors for like a blood clot that could be causing it, right? You're not on the birth control pill. You haven't traveled, you haven't had any surgeries or anything like that recently. No, no family, like no personal history of it. So that's also reassuring, right? So let me just review all the stuff we've ordered and then go from there. The fact that I can push right on your chest wall and triggers the pain makes me think it maybe it's more like MSK related. So sometimes we can get this what we call like enterochondrochondritis, which is the kind of the cartilage between our sternal bones and our ribs can get inflamed. And sometimes that can cause like that pinpoint really discrete pain that you're experiencing. Do you want something for the pain right now? I would love an apple or. Yeah. And it doesn't go down here. It's just literally all here. Yeah. Do you have a history of heartburn at all? Heartburn. Oh yeah. Maybe back in the day. Not anymore, no. Yeah. Okay. You don't get any regurgitation, like no acid coming up in your mouth? No. Do you take Tums or anything like that? No. No. OK. I do baking soda and water if I get heartburn. Yeah. My grandpa's always real. Sure. Yeah. All right. All right. Hang in there. Any questions at all for me? Nope. Just after I see you. And if nothing's wrong, I can go. Yeah. Yeah. And then you have a family doctor? Not. Not particularly. We do have a walking doctor you can maybe follow up for. Yeah, let me order you something like an ibuprofen or for the pain and see if that helps with it and then we'll go from there. OK, No problem. Here you go. Oh shit, OK. Here you go. Just one of a couple of other things I'd like to ask you with a chest. And you ever feel really sweaty with it? Well, that's what I'm saying. I'm starting to get off flashes and talking about, I don't know if it's just what's menopausal. And. Yeah, well, that's OK. Thank you. You know what? Yeah. Yeah. But other than that, no, no. OK. And any dizziness? No, no. OK. Good. Just wanted to clarify the. Yeah. OK. Yeah. Very good. Thank you. Oh, hi, Hi. Thank you so much. Perfect."

Two over months. Ohh. It's just been worse in the last two days. When it started about a month ago, what did it feel like then? Well, I'm taking the pills, you know, But when it started, what did it feel like a month ago in your body? Was it sharp or dull? Yeah. It starts slowly, slowly pain. And then now we're going worse. Yeah. OK. And the pain, when it was going on slowly, slowly for the last month, was it like sharp pain or kind of dull, aching pain? No. Was it slowly, slowly, you know, too sharp, constant? No, I understand. And when it was happening before this, the last two days, would it go away at all in the last month, just always there? And in the last month, when it's been coming and going, do you find anything makes it worse, like taking the stairs or anything like that? Like, did anything make it worse in the last month? Yeah, it was a pain all the time. Yeah, but any activities that made it worse in the last month, like, would you do anything and then it would get worse after that or you didn't? No, no, no. Like normal. I have pain, you see? Yeah, I hear. Don't see it here. It's something. Something. OK. Like something here. I'll examine it in a moment. Have you had any swelling on your legs? No, no, no. And no. And no breathing difficulties? No, that's. I'm feeling like a little bit heavy, you know. And where? What part of the body here? My chest. Do you want to pop your head on this way and bring your feet up? No stuff. My neck here is sore. Very full. You're going there. Listen. My lung here all around. Yeah, just start. I'll just start under here. So we're back here when I touch it. Yes. And where is this lump on your chest here? Is it sort of touch it? Yeah. It hurts to touch it, kind of. I feel under your armpit. OK. Your arm relax on mine. So is it sore to do that to it or to touch it? Yes, sorry. And have you had any falls at all like you've fallen on that side? No, sorry. No, no, no, this had nothing. But on the left side. I have. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. OK, A little bit or not. Good. OK. And in your arm, you said it was sore on the back. Yeah. Yes, this area. OK. So when I, when I touch on your neck and your armpit, I don't feel any lymph nodes that are enlarged. But I do think we should do an X-ray of your chest and then some blood work to look for make the heart, make sure the heart's OK. Make sure you don't have a little blood clot in your lungs today already. Yeah, Yeah, it does. Great. There's one more I'd like to add to that for the heart, maybe this chair right here. And then I'm going to look for some dangerous things that this could be to make sure you're OK. And then it like I'm going to try and make sure it's not something dangerous that's happening. And then from there we can adjust your medicines to try and get you better. OK, So you know, those scans something we're going to start with this X-ray and the blood work together will help us to know what we need to do. No, it's scan. Nothing. No, it's a scan. It's an X-ray. OK. That is a radiograph at the present time. It will help us to understand if you need a different one in addition to it. You said your legs are not sore. Is that correct? No, no, no, no. Yes. I have problem here with your knee. My knee? You're making noise. Oh, you can do the X-ray. This one before. How about have a look at it? Do you have a family doctor? Yeah, Yeah, I have it. This is. I have. When I go, you make Lick, lick, lick. Relax your legs like in there. So we're under my thumb. Yeah. Yeah. OK, going to arrange that. What we'll do next is you'll get go for X-ray, OK. When you come back, we'll give you some medicine to see if it helps with the pain. And I'm going to arrange some other blood tests for you. The first step will be to follow the signs for radiology for X-ray, go get chest X-ray, and then come back here and we'll do some more testing and some treatment. And then we'll look at the results together and see what else we need to do. OK."

You know, the every three months I undergo A and that's it, you know, and then just drink lots of water. That was five years ago. Back home 25 years ago. Yeah. Yeah. And where? Where's back home? Yeah. And then when I arrived here, you know, since then, uh, my hemoglobin is fine. But now I wanted to know that my hemoglobin is not, it's not really that high. It's not really, Yeah, it's not alarming, but it's a little bit higher than than before. So I think, umm, if you're OK with that, I'll make a referral to the hematology doctors. Yeah, sure. OK. Umm, so I'll, we'll send that in. And what's supposed to happen is they should contact you directly for, for an appointment. OK. I don't think it's at the level where they want to start doing phlebotomies. It's, it's only in the 100 and seventies, 175, seventies, not so really high. So my my doctor just to drink glass of water, right? I'm not sure that would change it very much, honestly. Yeah. So I'll take care of that. Now, as far as far as what's troubling you here today, it does not look like it's your heart or lungs. So do I think, you know, over the counter? So I think they're good. So yeah. So I think the ones that you told me about I think are ideal. So Tylenol you talked about then you talked about the topical Voltaren? Yeah. You know, every night, you know, I put something. Yep. So I think my. Because I can do my thing, right. I have my activities like biking, you know? Yeah. When you've been doing your activities without trouble. No, you haven't been doing your activities.

I'm a fourth year medical student that works with the Emerged office here. OK. I wanted to come and get a sense of what's been going on that brought you into the Emerged and then go from there. Well, if it was last night, I, I woke up at 3:00. I'm going to put you back on the cardiac monitor while you talk to the this lovely young lady. OK, So I just, I'm going to pull up your gown and then I'll leave you to it. That's OK. We'll let you get hooked up first. So let's no problem, 'cause I think he was initially an eighth appointment, he came in, but might be normal sinus. That's why I'm not his nurse. He just came back from somewhere. So you went to get a chest X-ray or no? Thank you so much. Yeah. Yeah, It was very regular. It just seemed a little bit, you know, that it was a it could be a bit, but it's not. It's good. Normal sinus. OK. Thank you. And your oxygen's pretty good there. OK, so you were telling me you were started saying that yesterday, the last evening I got up as I do through the night, went to the bathroom and I'm not I'm not in bed. And I laid down and I started to have sort of a funny feeling across my chest and I found that my legs found my back and dissipated, rolled on to my side. I can sort of feel these sensations when I hadn't felt before that around my I was concerned about my heart. OK, And then you came in. Did you come into the Emerge today? Walked into it, Yeah. So if you don't mind me asking, what made you come in sort of today versus, like, yesterday evening when you started feeling it? Well, it was 3:00 in the morning. Oh, is that when you came? Oh, I see. OK. And I phoned my doctor this morning, Doctor Smith. I was going to go into him and he's on holidays for the until next week. So I thought, well, I'll come in here and see what I can find out. OK, That makes sense. Some general questions for you. The pain that you're feeling, can you describe it to me? Well, right now I feel OK. I just feel OK. Yeah, it was. I say, during the night when I was laying there, I found that the lay to my back, it was OK. But when I started to one side or the other, I got this sort of pressure feeling that this I hadn't had before. And I was concerned about whether something was developing that I should be aware of. And. Gotcha. And so when you say pressure feeling, do you mean that it was something that was like a heavy like weight on your chest or a tightness or just a sensation that came that wasn't there before? OK. And you're, you're pointing in there. Is it in a specific location? It's all across my chest. Did it start in one spot or move around or don't really remember moving? I just felt coming up whenever I I don't know. OK so it's, it kind of was all across your chest, but it doesn't sort of that sensation doesn't like move to your shoulders or your back or anywhere like that somewhere. Hello. Hi. Well, right now I'm down in the area where Ma was several times and they're sort of examining me. I was out for X-rays and now I'm having a sort of a, an assessment here by one of the people here. Yeah. I'll be here for a while yet. So I I go to walk home after. OK, Appreciate it. OK, dear. All right. Bye. Bye, daughter. I love the wife. Sit in the pearly in intensive care and she's with her. Normally I'm in with her each day. And I didn't go this morning, so she's filling in there. OK, well, that's very nice. All right. So we were talking a little bit about the chest pain itself. And then you said it is it worse on one particular side that you that you sleep on? I didn't really have when I was laying on my back. I felt that's the same. It was going to like on either side. It seemed to come back OK. What about if you're leaning forward? Does that ever like make it worse better? Well, I'm just laying in bed, so I really wasn't leaning. OK. Sounds good. And have you had this kind of chest pain before? No, no, that's why I sort of felt that this is something developing. I'd like to check it before it got too developed. Now, since yesterday evening, have you had any like palpitations? No, I don't think seriously during the daytime to say I was there laying in bed because I've had all times have this sort of sensation. I was concerned. OK. And any trouble breathing, any feeling like you're going to faint and the chest pain itself, when it came on, does it come on very suddenly? Well, it just as I rolled over, I could feel it's developing OK and it didn't do shock. And when it comes on, how long does it stay stay there for when it develops? As long as I was laid over that position. So as long as you change positions, the the pain goes away. When I sat and I laid on my back again, it seemed to clear it up. So I and since that did you since that time yesterday evening at 3:00 AM, did you have that chest pain come back again went to that degree. I've had sort of a mild feeling there, but nothing to that same degree or sensation. OK, sounds good. And then no headache, no blurry vision or double vision for you any like leg swelling that you noticed? No, really nowhere else seemed to be affected to any degree. And then typically kind of outside of this chest pain, you have history of Afib, the atrial fibrillation that yes. OK. Do you remember when you were diagnosed with that? When I was in and we ran a had a monitor on for I think it was 48 hours or so recently. That was about 3 months ago. And I after that there really wasn't anything done. OK, Yeah. You've never had for your A-fib something called cardioversion before. You never needed to be put back into a different rhythm or anything like that. Different wish you've never had your heart needing to be put back and it's like a proper rhythm or anything like that. OK sounds heart any like nausea or vomiting that you've had recently any trouble like abdominal pain? Well, I, I don't have any abdominal pains, but I, when I have a mild move, but I find it's very, you know, liquidy and when I'm solid, I would like, OK. Is that something that syringe just yesterday. It's been like that for a while. For a while. How? More than like two weeks. Oh yes, I hear you. So nothing too pretty. It's been ongoing for quite a while. And anyone sick around you recently, have you done any sort of like exercises to like the chest wall or anything like that? That's been different? As I say, my wife is in the Furby, I live in, I would say probably about a kilometer away and I walk in quite frequently when the weather springs. So now just in general, do you take any medications? Well, just that one that I was sure. I I'm sure I have. I think we probably have a list of them. Yeah. You haven't had any changes to your medications, right? No changes recently to your medications, right? No, I just had that one that I've taken, which is, say a blood thinner. Yeah, probably for the atrial fibrillation. I don't know. I just what it's for, but I it's OK, you take it. I mean, I'm an obedient little boy and I take. OK good. And then in terms of any medical diagnosis that you have, besides the atrial fibrillation, do you manage any other medical conditions? Oh, OK. Yeah, it's perfect. That is good. I'm glad you have that on you. OK, sounds good. And then do you have any allergies? I was raised on the farm and I think that sort of made me so I can almost tolerate anything to anything. OK. OK. And then you've never had a heart attack before or any sort of cardiac heart history, right. And then the pain's been pretty much gone? Or is there still a little bit of pain? Yeah, it's more of a pain. It's more of a type of sensation. That's what it felt. OK. It's got a sharp and such. I hear you. And it's hard to to say where the location is. Is that what? I'm just right across my chest? Sounds good. Well, what I want to do is I want to have a listen to your lungs and your heart and just do a bit of a physical exam. And then I'll talk to my staff doctor and the resident doctor that I work for from there. And I know you had a chest X-ray, so I'm going to take a look at that as well. Any cough? So otherwise feeling good for my age. OK, good."

So it, it seemed at some point it may have gone away overnight, but then it in the morning, you know, I was able to fall asleep. But you know, so I don't know if it was, but it seemed better when I first woke up. I mean it seemed like normal rhythm, but then it then it went weird again very quickly.

I just felt like, yeah, almost like if you're working out too hard and then you get that kind of, you know, just have to sit down and felt like that kind of thing. Okay, inside, lay down for a bit, had supper and then I. Did you have chest discomfort or tightness when you were doing that? Did you get suddenly sweaty or short of? OK, So that happened a few days ago. It was Tuesday. Yeah. Before that, I've had symptoms again. It seemed like it was really eating and that kind of thing where I'll just suddenly feel very delays again. I don't know how else to explain it. It's very strange. So back in the last summer, had similar things. They ended up putting me on protein health inhibitors. They thought you had an ulcer. Yeah. So I did that for one month, went off it for a month, came back on for another month. And that seemed to help those symptoms. But then again, it's just sort of so those those symptoms are coming back like that, like heartburn. It's not quite heartburn. It's just again."

My name is Doctor Barrett. Michael's my first name. I'm one of the residents working in the emergency department this morning, in the afternoon. So what brings you here today? Well, I've been back and forth. Yeah, I was gonna. That's why I was gonna bring that up. I saw that. Yeah. Once here. Was it, you know, last week or or last month? Sorry. It was just a few days ago. Few days ago. And at the mall 4. So busy. The mall 4. It's because I started getting dizzy. I had my grandson and I had a friend and she says I don't know, you don't look good. I'm going to call an ambulance and they dropped me to the mall Fort and I said please don't bring me there. I I just don't. Anyways, I waited there for like 14 hours and then I said I've got to go. I've got a baby. What's more important in the baby or your life? They wanted to admit me and I said I can't. Why do they want to admit you? I don't know. OK, so tell me why you're here today. This time because of the burning and the headaches and the high blood, my blood pressure, I got to take it because I have to go tomorrow upstairs in the hypertension clinic. So they want a reading of me sitting, standing and it's just it's out of whack. It's not the same. What's out of whack? My blood pressure. I'll be like, what? What is that? A whack? One O 995. And now it's 14719. You got it written down? Yeah, I marked it all down. I've been marking. It's all over the place. But yeah, it's not it's not the way it's normally. What is it normally for you? One O 9 over. Whatever. OK, we're over. What? I'll I'll tell you. I don't know, we got to we got to get solid numbers here. Yeah. OK, whatever won't be an accept doctor. So tomorrow is the hypertension clinic. Yeah. It's not a cardio. It's not like a chest pain or a regular cardiologist. It's just it is. That's who. No, I know. I know a cardiologist who runs it, but they run different clinics. Right. So I'm just clarifying. It's they're checking on me because it's been irregular, my heart. And who's your family doctor? Doctor. Oh, I got a new one now. She left the other one for Doctor Roblinski, usually, but it's a new. I can't remember her name. Where do you go? See that? Riverside Court Medical Center. There it is. OK. That's because I have to go. It's all at the back there. You'll see the DS. And the first one would be the one that's today. So what are these days from? OK, these are just the last three days. That's the one sitting one O 3 / 4660 and then one O 4 / 59. This is sit and standing. And then the two standing. That was then. Now here's, yeah, 147. And then it goes. And then So what day is this from? These two? Those those were, those were Thursday because I got to take him a week before. OK, so just go back. Sorry. And this was today. Yeah, today and this, Oh, wait, yeah, today. This is today at 721-3469 and 59. OK. And what are you normally what like here 10310497 That's all I've ever been over the 50. But this 59 is is is unusual too, OK, because usually it's a little bit, you know, so normally you kind of low hundreds. And what is your second number usually like? Usually in 686970 I want."

I took part. I went off to work. You took what? Oh, yeah. I took off to work and then, uh, while I was driving, I felt like a vomiting right? And at the same time, like in between and on side, left side, like not completely here, but somewhere over here. I, I felt like a pain. It was not like a, you know, like pain. It was like a point something. OK, OK. And then it's went off. Well, is it completely gone now? Now it's OK, OK, Yeah. OK What, by what time was it completely gone? It's like, you know, uh, when I came in here after 10-15 minutes, OK, I did because my blood pressure was also high. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So like that time, it was there, but then eventually it settled up. OK. OK. Were you short of breath at any point? So while I was in car, I had that. So I had to like bleed from my mouth. Oh, OK. For it was not for long period, but for like some instance. OK. And how about what did you get hot and sweaty, like drips? Well, no, nothing like that. All right. Were you coughing at all? Oh, no.

No, because we'll change the paper. Yeah. In the last week, have you been taking anything like aspirin or Advent? Oh, no, no. So I just had a head transplant surgery. Oh, did you? So I in India. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So it's working. It is. It is. Yeah. So my goodness, it's great. Yeah. So I have. I'm taking biotin for that. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's the only my. OK going on. I just have to get a step. Yeah, None. So do you only have to go once for that? For this? Yeah. Yeah, it was, it was just one short 11. And how long does it take them to the surgery? It was like 5 hours and they put like 505,000 grams. Wow. Were you awake the whole time? Yeah, yeah. It was a local and it's they talking to you? Oh yeah, they did it. Yeah. It was just a bit painful when they initially put the they did a plasma. What? What they call it PR platelet rich plasma. They implanted. I see. And that's how they did it. Yeah. Wow. All right, let me have a look. Just breathe normally, OK? And then I'm going to lift your shirt, turn the back, mouth open, big breath in and in and in, OK? And then head here and down here. OK. And then how do you spell the name of this medication? Like it's it's I to be honest, I don't know the exact name. Yeah, but it has biotin 10MG. And then it's like it has other like vitamins like flax seeds or something. It's like a vitamin, but it all the IT has like a seven days have separate medication, but all have biotin 10MG in it. Biotin. All right. OK. You can, you can sit up for me. OK. Did they do a cardiogram? OK, I'm going to go look at that and then I'll come back. OK, None. None. Hi there. Terry, you're going to this room down here. OK, Wonderful. Thank you. Straight where that gentleman is straight behind him. OK. Thank you so much. Thank you. Hi. How did it go? She said she was coming back or she went to look ECG. OK, OK. So maybe I'll leave it. Yeah. And then I'll come back for it a little later. All right. See ya. She is. Yes. Thank you. Yeah. So it's all good. Your cardiogram is good and the the blood work is good. No signs of your heart being involved at all. So it was most consistent. The episode was most consistent with GERD. You can look it up when you go home. But we another word for that is reflex. It's just like a bit of passage goes up. Usually it's like if you're not, if you're not, if you don't suffer from this in the past, it probably won't come back. But if it does, because sometimes, you know, if we have a little episode, sometimes we have some irritation for a few days. If it comes back, you don't need a prescription. You can just go buy Pepsi AC at the at the pharmacy and just take it twice a day for three to five days and we'll usually take care of it. OK, All right, You take care. And yes, it looks great. I'm really impressed. I've got a great job. Yeah. You must love it. Oh, yeah. You look in the mirror. You just. I was concerned if it works or not, but yeah, it it's nice. Long hair, have a ponytail. Looks. Let's see how it looks. OK. Thank you so much, Doctor. OK. I don't know if we should take this out. Probably. Yeah, I'll just take it out and take it to the desk. OK."

         "Well, thanks for reminding me on that. I I was like, want me to do the one thing yeah yeah for sure five last night I was feeling this real pain in my arm. Honestly, I don't feel it now yeah the the strength in my hand is back. I I do feel a little bit, yeah, a numbness in my forearm for like, the strength, man. I could feel that I wasn't able to cut properly. So I was like, OK, and then have a pain guard on my chest and I was like, OK, so the arm came first and then the chest afterwards. Yeah. So can you walk me through, like, when you woke up in the morning yesterday, was it a normal day for you? Yeah. Like I didn't do anything when didn't. What time do you think all your symptoms started? I told her, like around 8:30 PM. Yeah. And what were you doing at that time? I was playing games. OK. So I wasn't like, is this like video games? Yeah. Yeah. So you're doing that. Did the pain come on very suddenly, or was it something you just started gradually noticing it? I don't. I wanna say it was sudden, but like, it was there for a while. Yeah. And I just thought it was like I mentioned in my friend and he said, well, maybe you just slept on your arm trip. And I was like, OK, sure. But then this morning I purposely slept on my back. Yeah. And like elevated. And it's still, yeah, it's still there. And so when it was in your arm, what part of your arm did you notice at first in honestly, it was like the hand. It was just like, like, I guess I could feel the the losses in my hand, but it was just like the whole thing, like, and did pain come first? It's not pain. It's like, it was like tingling. Tingling. Yeah. OK, tingling. The whole arm as well. Yeah. Like both sides, all the fingers. Not even on both sides. Maybe not my back. Yeah. OK. But like, all down here. Yeah. OK, so you're playing, You start to notice this tingling. Was there any pain or no pain? There's pain in my chest. Yeah. I came out through that in my arm. And then you mentioned like the the strength. Yeah. Did that come at the same time as the tingling? Yeah. I was like eating and I could feel it. And then I was trying to cut chicken and I'm right-handed, so I was cutting it. Yeah. But I couldn't. I was like struggling to like hold it. OK. So I was like, OK, I thought it was just like maybe muscle strain or something like a nerve thing. OK. But then the the chest. So that was like, OK, maybe it's something else. And was there any like muscle injury or like new movements that you're doing? Anything that could have provoked this? Really. I told her that I was thinking about it when I was sent down. I was like, maybe something. Yeah, I told her that not recently. This is a while ago. Yeah. I fell on my back and I didn't 'cause I just fell on my back was like in the morning. I was like, OK, I felt my back knocked it out of me. I'm fine. I didn't feel something. Yeah, in my like up here, but I didn't get checked out. How long ago was this? This was like maybe 2-3 years ago. OK, Yeah, it's quite a lot. And I was like, OK, And I was thinking about it. I was like, maybe I got up weird and maybe it maybe something I was like puncture, but maybe something did something or something, you know, Yeah, yeah. So I was like, OK, but I also thought of, I still have Google, which I probably shouldn't have. I also thought of heartburn. OK, but I didn't eat anything. Yeah. I literally just ate chicken. So I was like, it can't be heartburn. So tell me about the pain portion then. So in the chest. Yeah. It's like a sharp pain right here. Yeah, when I push down, I feel it. Yeah. This morning when I push down on it to check, I was like feeling around. I feel like feel you only have cold sweat. OK. I can feel like a cold feeling again. So I was like, OK, I wasn't feeling shortness of breath like again. Yeah, I didn't breathe. That was fine. Yeah. Didn't hurt you to do that. No, it was more so like when I if I were to like move fast, like pick something up. Yeah. In my life. And then that was it. Yeah. But that was that was like the most experience. And in general, when you walk around, yes, it's not harder to do that. You don't feel short of breath, no sensation of passing out. No, last night maybe I was, I wasn't passing out, but I could also just been tired. You know, there's a lot of yeah, research like that was like, maybe I was tired. Do you feel like your heart was racing? Racing. It was like you could, it was being fast, but I wasn't too like, yeah, too bad. But have you had any troubles with your heart I should know about? Not like a heart problem, but I was here previously for the same reason. OK. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. I saw that you had an ACG done before, which is actually really helpful because I have subject comparison. But in general, you're not known for any heart issues, any medical conditions at all. No, I just have narcolepsy, OK. And I take Vitalin for it. Yeah. I haven't taken the Vitalin for maybe 2-3 months now. Yeah, I did tell her that I do smoke weed. I take it from a fake pen. So that also, I don't know, that also could be something it sounds like you're not really having like a lot of breathing issue. Yeah, I'm not like I can, Yeah. And then either. What is that, though? That's the sting of the thing. Yeah. And then in general, let's say in the last few weeks, anything that have changed, like heart pains, any like cough, cold, fever, because that can actually lead to some of this stuff, cough or cold, as I normally don't get sick. Yeah, like that. Like I just woke up when I was fine. Yeah. And then I was sitting down and then I was like, boom. And I was like, OK, OK, let's check a couple things here. Get your bag. So if I pass along the bones here, 'cause this is where a lot of the joints are. Any pain in there? There's pain. Yeah. Yeah, it's not, it's not pain. It's like pressure. Yeah, like there's not pressure on this side. Yeah. So more on this side. Yeah. Interesting. OK, arms up like this and then don't let me push down. OK. Now make a muscle for me and don't let me pull it apart. Good. Give my hands a push. Push, push, push, push, push, push. Good. Arms straight. All right, wrist straight like that. Don't let me bend them. OK. Good. And again, don't let me push more. Don't let me go curl my fingers. Good. And spread all your fingers out nice and straight. Don't let me push them in. OK, to keep them out as much as you can. Good. So the strength is good right now. Do you feel any? I can't touch exactly the same, But do you feel they're about the same? Well, my left arm is weaker than my right arm for sure. But they are about normally now. And the the sensation feels about back to normal. Yeah. Like it's maybe just like, no, like I, yeah, like before. I wasn't able to do this before. I was like, it was like that. Yeah. Now I can do this. So I don't know. And then no, like, at that time, you didn't have any problems with your vision, your speech, your arm was generally moving. Yeah, like, I could do stuff. I was talking to my friend. I was like, on the phone. So I'm like, I don't. Yeah, Yeah. Like I, I had a chance of looking at your blood work beforehand. Now, one of the things that we do is test to make sure that it's not like a heart stress or strain. That's a negative test for you. And again, you had the ECG before, which is the heart tracing, and it's the same as the last one. Yeah. So from a heart perspective, I really don't think that this is like a heart issue. OK. This like, so like the other question there. Yeah. So you can get inflammation in the little joints. That's kind of just thinking. Yeah. And that easily can cause that sort of like sensation that radiates down. It doesn't usually cause weakness of the hand. OK, so that's one thing I do want you to just kind of check for like, let's say this goes away, it's a blip in time. It probably was just the inflammation. OK, but if you're like sitting there and you're like, actually I feel like it's getting more and more weak. I don't I don't like I don't want you to have to like hyper think about though, 'cause then you'll be like, oh, is it is it not like that that can get really stressful. But if you're just like, you know, over the next few days, or even if, like, all of a sudden you're like, whoa, this is much, then just come back here, OK. Because the weakness is something I do want to make sure that we're addressing right now when I examine you. Yeah. Like, it feels normal to me. And it sounds like it's normal to you. So keep it and keep an eye on that. Do you think it's probably heartburn? No. OK, again, like we, it's a good thought, but heartburn shouldn't cause like tingling. It's like, yeah, the arm thing doesn't make sense. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it would be a bit unfair for me to just yeah, yeah, totally. It's hard. Yeah, yeah. So that's, that's kind of like the main things to look for. I don't think there's anything worse than the dangerous right now. Yeah. I mentioned to her I did too much research. I mentioned to her that I I was like, could a cyst have developed in that area like from the fall? Not as I mean that too, but like I am prone to getting cyst apparently. So I'm like maybe something just decided to grow there and said because like I have one here, I got removed. Yeah. So I'm like, I don't know. Yeah, the the usually like those cysts are more like skin cysts. OK. But to cause like that nerve that goes all the way down, you have to be like much deeper. It's like a like you have to nerve thing. Yeah. OK. So I don't think that that like something that's just on the skin would be causing that sort of pressure. Do you think tingling back, do you think it's just like muscle strain? Like I yeah, I think there's just like an element of the inflammation is my best guess right now. Do you think I should take a medication for it? This is about how much it bothers you. Like the one thing you could try is to do it. It's not like it. It's not myself, like the, the arm I'm worried about. Yeah, it's what the arm. It's whatever this is doing. Yeah. What's causing it, Right. I think like an anti-inflammatory. OK. Because I, I think that the main thing I can see is, is that so doing something like an Advil as it's recommended on the bottle would be something that could actually address both of these things. Advil. Yeah. I'm not going to remember that. I have. I can write it down for you. I'll get you a little paper on the way out. Yeah. And I'll write down those things to look out for as well. That sound OK? Yeah. OK. All right, perfect. We'll get you going from here. So why don't you follow me out. OK. All right. I think I stopped this here, I guess. Oh yeah."
